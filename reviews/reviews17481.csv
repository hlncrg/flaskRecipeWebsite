"3443","5","This cake is fabulous! And it actually tastes just like a really good sugar cookie! I doubled the recipe and used 2 tbsp. of vanilla and 1 & 1/2 cups of milk. This cake is moist, dense and above all delicious! Plus it only took 35 minutes to bake. It was perfect for a cookies n cream cake. I will definitely make this again!"
"2827","5","This recipe is SO WONDERFUL!  (Be advised that this recipe as it stands is for a 9x9 cake not a 9x13 large cake.)  I 'taste-tested' it this past weekend to see if it was good enough to use at my daughters B-Day party... and OH MY GOSH everyone loved it! It is a dense cake, so if you are looking for light and fluffy, keep looking. But If you are looking for really good 'wedding cake' type of cake... here it is!  I put on the 'Buttercream icing' from LISKAGIRL on this site and it was really good combo!! One person said the cake with the frosting tasted almost like a really good sugar cookie! But it was not overpowering sweet. I followed other reviewers and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I also beat the heck out of every step. MAKE SURE you beat the sugar and the butter for 8-10 minutes!! BUT IT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT!! I couldn't keep away from it!"
"2297","4","This recipe actually deserves 4 1/2 stars. I made it twice in the same night. The first batch was perfect! 5 stars all the way. The batter was rather fluffy. I made it the second time around (I don't think I let the eggs beat as long) The batter was a lot thinner (although both times I added about 1/4 cup of extra milk). After baking, The first batch was fantastic! Great cake, easy to frost. The second time around, however, deserves about 3 stars. As others have said, it had a cornbread type element to it. It was bad, but it was incredibly hard to frost. I made 9x13, 8x11, 9x9, and 4x9 of this cake and it cooked well and evenly in every pan. All I can say is, pay very close attention to the directions, sift your ingredients, and let your eggs beat awhile. If your batter looks somewhat like yellowish coolwhip, you're gonna have a great cake :)"
"1056","5","I've long ago learned to be skeptical of the results with white cake recipes. They can be dry, tasteless, or have what some call a similarity to cornbread. I wanted a white cake that was moist, sweet and flavorful, without having to resort to a pound cake recipe, which would be heavier. I wanted a light, fluffy cake with a tender crumb. Butter isn't going to necessarily get you that, nor is a shortage of eggs or sugar. In this recipe I was tempted to reduce the amount of flour, and increase the amount of sugar and eggs but decided to leave it alone, especially for the sake of properly accessing this recipe - except for one small change, which probably was an important one. I used half butter for flavor and richness, and half shortening, to help ensure moistness. Cream the shortening and butter very well with the sugar, a good few minutes, add each egg separately and beat well after each addition. I added the WHOLE milk alternately with the flour mixture, beginning and ending with the flour, and mixing lightly, only enough to combine the ingredients. I made cupcakes, and dropped about 1/2 tsp. raspberry jam in the center of the batter before baking. I frosted them with pink buttercream frosting. I tasted one before I frosted them to make an accurate judgment of their quality. Perfect. Moist, yes moist! Tender, flavorful and pleasantly sweet. The failure or success of this recipe is hugely dependent upon proper mixing technique and not overbaking!"
"859","2","I thinks it pretty crazy that 1280 people actually reviewed a baking recipe that doesn't have vanilla extract and salt, the two most crucial ingredients. I think this recipe is great with following changes: 1-2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, increase milk to 3/4 cup and use buttermilk if you have it. Also if you want a lighter texture you really need to use cake flour, if you don't have any make you own by replacing 2 tbsp of cornstarch in 1 cup of all purpose."
"748","5","This is by far the simplest and tastiest cake recipe I've ever tried. I like to add a bit extra milk which keeps it soft and moist."
"744","5","I made this twice last week, for both my daughter's birthdays. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and the cupcakes were a little dry, but still edible. The second time, I upped the vanilla to a full tablespoon and added about 1/8 cup more milk. They came out very moist and delicious!"
"418","5","Yum! i just made cupcakes with this recipe and they're delicious! I don't know why many people said that their cake was dense and dry, mine turned out fluffy and moist and yummy! This is a great recipe as long as you cream the butter til it's VERY fluffy and light, as well as when you add the eggs. I added a touch more milk, but other than that i followed the recipe exactly. It was great, way better that a mix, it's not as sugary and sticky. Thank you for this recipe, it's delicious!"
"331","5","As advertised, it is simple to make and easy to change into whatever is needed for the occasion. We started this one off without changing the recipe and it came out nice. Can't wait to start fiddling with it.  It's been a nearly a year and we've changed this up a few times for the better. If you want to stick as close to the recipe try this variation out.   Add 1 egg yolk, 1 teaspoon of butter flavoring and substitute half and half for the milk. If you have a kithenaid mixer, break out the whip instead of the batter blade. It produces a fluffier batter. Mix it until it puffs up a bit and bake it for the 30-40 mins. We used a 9x9 glass pan. Now if you have gotten to the 40 min mark and the center is still a bit liquidy, turn the oven down to 250 and let it sit on the top shelf of oven for an addtional 10 mins. It will set up well this way and you don't risk burning the edges of the cake.   This cake was gone in 1 setting when my in laws dropped in. We've also mixed strawberry jam into the butter/egg mixture and gotten great results and we've done a chocolate version by making the milk into a cocoa mixture. Next up to try will be spumoni. We love to experiment!"
"269","5","THis came out PERFECTLY. I added more milk (3/4 cup) per other reviewers' suggestions and I also added some lemon extract and lemon zest to taste. It was the first thing I made in my new kitchenaid mixer and I was very impressed with the results. I made little flower cupcakes in my flower pan and dipped each one in glaze (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Vanilla-Glaze/Detail.aspx) - I added lemon extract to the glaze as well. These stayed moist and delish for days!"
"222","5","Works great using soy milk instead of regular."
"124","5","After several attempts I was ready to give up on this recipe because it kept coming out so dense. I was reading another white cake recipe that gave times for beating. So, I tried it again and this time it came out SOOO much better (light and fluffy). Here is what I did: I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk but all other measurements I kept the same; beat the butter (which is softened) and sugar together for 10 min. on high using an electric mixer; then beat 5 min after each egg is added (I did NOT separate the white and yolk); I mixed the dry ingredients together; I alternated the flour mixture and milk into the batter ending with milk (add some flour mixture, then mix, then add some milk and then mix, then some more flour mixture and so forth); I brought the eggs, butter, and milk to room temperature before using. If you follow these steps you will have a fluffy, great tasting cake."
"117","4","My 14 year old son likes to make this recipe. It is a nice cake with a good texture. We use regular flour, not cake flour, and it turns out fine."
"82","4","This is really a five star recipe... if these few tips I gathered from the reviews are followed. (This recipe did double well for us.)  1.Do whip the butter and sugar for at least 8 minutes, and beat ingredients well at all stages 2. Aim for a yellow fluffy cool whip type batter texture prior to moving on to adding new ingredients 3. Do add an extra 1/4 cup of milk and increase the amount of vanilla"
"67","5","Super simple! I made it with a half recipe of 'Banana Butter Icing,' also from this Web site, and served it to a very happy two-year-old birthday boy! Thanks for the recipe!"
"63","5","Ok, I think I've figured it out. Perhaps some of you are comparing this 'homemade' cake to the boxed cakes. There is a difference. The boxed cakes include ingredients such a corn syrup and preservatives and other junk. That is why they taste so 'good.' This is a SIMPLE cake made from real food. It has a more floury taste when compared to box, but I find it to be a very mellow flavor. It was not foamy like boxed recipes, though it could not be considered 'hard.' This is honestly what REAL cake tastes like. Forget the box. This is better tasting, and better for you! (I even screwed up the recipe and had to add 1/4 cup of flour after the initial mixing. I think it's kind of hard to mess this up.) If you want to try a cake from scratch, this is the way to go. Good luck!"
"34","5","I have just this minute finished baking this delighful cake with a young ten year old autistic child...and he and I are both thrilled! Thank you for sharing this with us! A beautiful rainy day project! The dividends reap great rewards for some time allowing him to feel proud of his labors!!"
"33","5","This cake was simple to make and is light and fluffy and tastes great. I did not change the recipe and used two 6' greased pans - I will be able to tort and fill each cake to make a nice tall cake! Thanks for the recipe!"
"32","3","First of all, I used this recipe to make cupcakes, which I would NOT recommend. I may try this recipe again in the future to make a cake, in which case I may change my rating. However, the cupcakes were for a friend for her daughter's 3rd birthday so they had to be cute. The cupcake tops cooked into each other and were flat and ugly. I tasted one and thought it was on the dry side, and I only cooked them for 15 minutes. I've made TONS of cupcakes before, both from scratch and from box mixes, and have never had cupcakes turn out this badly. I ended up starting all over again with a different white cake recipe, which turned out so much better - both on looks and taste."
"27","5","I made this recipe as cupcakes tonight as a test batch since I'm making cupcakes for my cousin's birthday tomorrow. I followed other reviewers' advice, beat the batter thoroughly and beat the eggs thoroughly until fluffy, added 1/4 cup more milk, and the batter did end up very light and fluffy. The cupcakes came out of the oven perfectly domed on the top, but quickly fell flat. I piped pink peppermint frosting onto them when they cooled, and tried one. I was very impressed with the texture, and they did not stick to the liner at all when I pulled it away. But the flavor left a little to be desired. It tasted way too flourey and not sweet like I thought it would be. I had also added 2 tsp more of vanilla to the batter in hopes it would bring more flavor to the cake. Didn't work. I would make this cake again, but only if I could figure out a way to tone down the flour flavor. Update: I went ahead and used this recipe again for my cousin's birthday cupcakes, but I added about a tsp of honey to it. I made her rainbow cupcakes, so I'm not sure if the food coloring had something to do with it, but it came out much better this time around. It was sweet, and went perfect with my buttercream frosting. I'm upping my rating to 5 stars."
"21","1","I did as others recommended and we didn't care for it. My children wouldn't even eat it. I make cakes as a side job and never have I witnessed such failure in a recipe. I wonder if using cake flour would make a difference. I will stick to my nearly falling-apart-cake as apposed to this cornbread concoction. I give it one star simply b/c I was able to transform it into a lady finger style sandwich with nutella."
"20","5","Simple and incredibly tasty! Instead of using vanilla extract I used orange extract (just because that's what I was in the mood for) and it turned out great. I then divided the batter, added about two tablespoons of cocoa powder to one, and layered it to make orange/cocoa cupcakes. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"19","4","I baked this recipe for 240 of my students. They loved it. However I thought it was a little dry. When I made it again (just one cake this time) I added a package of instant vanilla pudding and about half of cup extra milk. This made it very moist. It is a very simple recipe and was a great way to introduce baking to my students."
"18","5","I made this when I had to make some cupcakes. I followed the recipe exact, except I thought the batter was too thick. So I added about 1/4 cup more milk. This made about 12-14 cupcakes, so I would suggest doubling the recipe if you need 24 cupcakes or a larger cake. They baked up wonderfully, it was a dense, moist yummy cake. I hand mixed this in a bowl because I did not want to over mix the batter, which can produce a tougher cake. It tasted like a sugar cookie in cake form, delicious."
"18","5","I baked this recipe today with no changes, and it is perfect!! A few tips... 1.) beat the butter and sugar until FLUFFY this takes about 2 good minutes 2.) add eggs one at a time and make sure its blended well in between. 3.) SIFT the flour and baking powder together 4.) Finally, let the batter mix at med. speed for a good 2 minutes This should give you delicious results every time !"
"17","4","Very nice flavor and texture. I made 12 HUGE cupcakes from this batter. As they mushroomed well over the top of the muffin pan, I had a little difficulty getting them out after cooling for a bit. Took the advice of others and added 1/4 cup more milk and 1/4 tsp. more vanilla extract. Will make these again but will try in the 9 x 9 pan."
"16","5","This is the best cake I have ever tasted. I typically think of white cake as kind of bland but this was not at all. I was a little worried because the batter had a slight aftertaste but once it was baked it had disappeared. The people that are getting a dense cake must be doing something wrong and I have a feeling I know what it is. They are so afraid of over-mixing the batter that they are under-mixing it. I creamed the butter by itself, then added the sugar a cup at a time(I doubled the recipe), then I added the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each, then I added the rest of the dry ingredients a cup at a time(after mixing them together with a whisk, since I don't have a sifter), and then once I added the milk I mixed it on high for about 3 minutes. When I put the batter in the pan it was almost the same consistency as cool whip. I cooked it for 35 minutes exactly and it was golden brown on top and moist and fluffy on the inside. The finished product was like eating a sugar cookie flavored cloud. The only thing I changed about the recipe was to add an extra 1/4 cup milk like other reviewers suggested. I iced it using a simple buttercream frosting(dyed green for st patrick's day) and it was absolute perfection. My husband loved it as well. He ate his piece in about 30 seconds and is planning on taking some to work tomorrow to share(if it stays in the house I will eat it all lol)."
"16","5","I really like this recipe, the cake is not super light and fluffy but it is not that heavy either.  I did add another 1/4 cup of milk to this recipe and a splash more vanilla extract.  Also for those who may not know make sure your butter is at room temperature, use your hand mixer to cream the butter and then add the sugar in a little at a time, blending until creamed and incorporated into your butter, you want a nice creamy whipped butter and sugar mix. Adding the butter in cold and combining all the ingredients at once will leave you mixing for a while. And adding the mixture in while there are still very visible sugar crystals will weigh down the cake which is why some are getting a more corn bread like cake."
"16","5","This is my very first cake from scratch, and I am so pleased w/the results! I think the key to this cake is (as many other people have mentioned) really taking the time to beat the butter and sugar together, then adding each egg separately and beating it all together for a good while. halfway through the baking process I realized I ran out of (of all things) vanilla extract, so I used almond instead and I highly recommend making this with almond extract. I did increase the milk to 3/4 cup as others suggested. My end result was a moist and fluffy cake that had a lovely almond flavor. This recipe was so easy and the results were so wonderful that I don't think I'll be using the box mixes again. I see now that there is a huge difference and taking the time to make this from scratch was well worth it. Thank you very much for this recipe!"
"14","5","This cake is one of the most delicious cakes I have ever tasted. I use this recipe as a base for other cakes, its quite outstanding. One downside is it tends to get dry with larger pans...anything larger than a 11x13 and the corners dry out. I have tweaked it to the best of my ability but no luck. Otherwise it stays moist and delicious and is great for layers!"
"13","5","Tried as written....Recipe may be simple, but the taste/texture was amazing! No more store bought cake mixes for this gal!"
"13","1","I was thorougly disappointed with this recipe. Allrecipes.com has never really let me down before, until I tried baking this cake. At first, it browned rather quickly but the middle of the cake wasn't done. It made me nervous to continue cooking it, but it was necessary. When I finally took it out, it was a little darker than golden brown on top and resembled a yellow color. This was NOT a white cake at all. It fell apart, despite the fact I greased the pan, and the best way to describe the taste is sweet cornbread. When I first tasted this 'cake', it immediately took me to a time of tasting cornbread. I tried to salvage the situation by loading it down with icing but it still was not like any cake I've had before. I expected so much more from this recipe. A part of me knew that when using a whole egg there was no way it was going to be white to begin with, but I could live with that. But, none of me knew I'd spent time trying to make cornbread, basically. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is in the mood to have moist, delicious cake. If you are, then this is NOT the recipe for you."
"12","5","I find it rather annoying when people just write how they modified the recipe and made it better. Orwhen someone gives it a bad rating for not following the directions or just failing to give it another try. That said, I did not find anything wrong with this recipe and I proudly give it 5 stars. Its a great cake recipe but I would not call it White as it has the egg yolks included so its yellow. It uses all natural ingredients though I can say its best to use full fat milk in it. If you want to cut down on fat eat a salad with lemon juice dressing for your meal. I live in Germany and used Irish butter and Full Fat milk 3.8% Fat, the cake did not have a cornbread texture at all. I do use a Kitchen Aid maybe that helps. The long whipping time of the butter, sugar gives the rich consistency but I would add, that a bit more milk might help, especially with my frailing oven. The only thing I did modify was to add a pinch of sea salt as I had unsalted butter. I made this for my sons 4th birthday, baked in the Nordicware Pirate Boat pan, I had to change the servings to 18 which fillled the pan perfectly! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"11","5","This recipe was wonderful! The batter was too thick for me at first, so I added a little more milk, so that instead of 1/2 cup, it was more like 3/4-1 cup. I suggest adding milk to desired consistency. The cake was moist and was nothing like cornbread. I made cupcakes and added buttercream frosting, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Simple, yummy recipe! I plan to use this recipe again. Edit to add: Use plenty of vanilla and/or lemon flavoring."
"11","1","This is the first time no one in my family of 5 refused to eat cake. Even my husband who eats any kind of cake threw it away. I had the computer automatically double the recipe for me so maybe that was the problem. The cake was hard and dry and resembled bad cornbread or hard pancakes. Yuk!"
"10","2","I made a double recipe because I wanted a 9-inch layer cake. I'm a very experienced baker, and I found this cake to be heavy and dry. My husband commented that it was like a pound cake...I think he was being kind. Maybe using cake flour instead of all-purpose flour would have helped. In the future, I'm going to stick with my trusted Bonnie Butter Cake recipe for white cake. It's moist, light and delicious."
"10","4","Although this recipe was pretty good, I would have to agree with another user who said that it tastes like sugar cookies. On it's own I think the cake is delicious, but with frosting it didn't taste qutie right. As other users commented I too added a little more milk."
"10","5","I made some changes like I used 1/3 cup of crisco butter shortening but you can use reg. crisco, I creamed it with the suger and butter and I out 3 eggs not 2, I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 1/3 teaspoon of almond extract.The almond really set's this cake off and I only 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and I also used 1 1/2 cup of butter milk. I like the to use the buttermilk,crisco because it will help your cake not to be dry bake this cake oneday before you need it and oh my God it is so so good. Waiting that one day help this cake's tast to come out .PS IF YOUR LOOKING TO MAKE A NICE MOST YELLOW CAKE all YOU HAVE TO DO IS USE THE BETTER crisco shortening IT HELP CHANGE THIS CAKE FROM A NICE WHITE CAKE TO A NICE YELLOW MOST CAKE. BUT DON'T FORGET USE THE BUTTER MILK IT REALLY HELPS,I WOULD GIVE THIS CAKE 10 STARS.THANKS FOR GIVING ME 2 GOOD CAKE'S OUT OF ONE"
"9","5","I have used this recipe 3 times in the last two weeks, it is THAT good! I did a triple batch and split in two baking sheets for about 1-2 inch tall cakes, then filled them. It did get a bit burnt on the edges, while the middle was moist, so next time I may bake it at a lower temperature for a little longer time."
"9","4","4 1/2 stars! Great cake! Came out perfect, used the recipe for a wedding cake.  I did however change the milk to 2/3 cup and added a table spoon of vegetable oil, for moisture and preventing it turning into a corn cake crumble. That little trick made all the difference! I recommend you do so also! :)"
"9","4","This is a great cake with an amazing crust that tastes just like a sugar cookie. You need to wait for the butter to reach room temperature and then you should cream it with a mixer. After you cream it, THEN add in the sugar and cream both of them for a long time, just like other people have said. Also, sift all your dry ingredients. If you do these things, the texture of your cake will be incredible and completely not like corn bread.  Also, very importantly, I would definitely add 1/4 cup of heavy cream and a little more vanilla. I added the 1/4 cup of heavy cream and the moisture was just right, however, it needed some more flavor, that's why I'm saying to increase the amount of vanilla extract. Or, alternatively, you might add raspberry extract, coconut extract, orange extract, lemon extract, etc. in addition to the recommended amount of vanilla extract depending on your taste. This won't disappoint."
"9","5","My child's favourite cake, and she helps me make it too! The only change I make to this recipe is that I mix the sugar and butter in a LARGE bowl. Otherwise, I run out of space for mixing."
"9","4","Would have been 5 stars if I hadn't had to add the additional 1/4 that others, thankfully, suggested. With that single change, however, I got a dense, almost pound-cakey texture and a very happy birthday girl. This is definitely a keeper, and so much better than a box it's not even funny. Like night and day. TIP: Beat the ingredients really well, as others suggested. Your patience will be rewarded."
"9","5","I used 1 TBL. vanilla and ff 1/2 & 1/2. Very nice and easy! Thanks!"
"9","2","I must say, this was extremely disappointing :( I made these into cupcakes, and they came out extremely flat and dense. I did exactly as instructed in the directions, but they just didn't work out."
"9","1","Maybe it comes out better as cupcakes. My friend and I both tried it and it was more like a coffee cake. Not at all what we thought it would be."
"8","5","Yummy!!! We love it!"
"8","5","YUMMY~! I added some red food coloring to make it red and put it in little hearted papers. It came out beautiful. I will use this recipe again and again"
"8","4","DEFINITELY add 1/4 c. more milk it makes this cake absolutely perfect. Moist, and dense makes it the best white cake recipe ive tried, great for a wedding cake. I will be using this witht he milk adjustment as my usual white cake recipe from now on. If you are looking for light and airy this is not the cake for you, but I love the texture of it! I baked for full time"
"8","5","I made this cake for my friend's birthday and WOW! This is awesome. I made a large 9'x13', two layered cake. If you want a 9'x13' layered cake, double the amount of the recipe and then divide the batter between three 9'x13' pans. This way your layers will have the best thickness (my layers were too thick, I will make a 3 layer cake next time). For the frosting I whipped two cups of heavy whipping cream with 3/4 cup of confectioner sugar and 4 tbsp of cocoa liquor to my desired consistency. For the filling I peeled and chopped 10 small apples and boiled them with 1/2 cup of water and 2tbsp of sugar until it was soft and jam like. I added a zest of one lemon into this jam, coated the layers with the frosting and filled them with this filling. And for the cake, I substituted vanilla with the zest of one medium orange. I received so many wows in the party and everyone loved the cake. It took a lot of time but it is definitely worth it. Oh and two more things: add 1/4 cup more milk as other users suggested and beat every step very well. Thanks for posting this recipes SCOTTOSMAN."
"8","1","I am an avid baker and I know I followed the recipe to a 't', but was disappointed. I won't make this again."
"7","2","READ THIS REVIEW, not the most popular ones! -- I don't know what it is with this cake. Some reviewers rave over it. Some reviewers say it turned out dry. The secret, they say, is adding extra milk (1 1/2 cups total in a doubled recipe), extra vanilla (2T in doubled recipe), and beating the fire out of it when creaming the sugar/butter & adding the eggs. Well, I am on the lookout for the perfect white cake recipe, and this one was recommended to me, so I decided to try it out when I was asked by a friend to provide the cake for her birthday party. I avidly read reviews, followed the above instructions to a T, and kept my fingers crossed. I even subbed vanilla bean paste for the vanilla, creating some truly phenomenal cake batter. Unfortunately, once baked, the cake did indeed turn out dry and crumbly. Edible, for sure, but disappointing. So, it sounds like this cake is a shoot, pure and simple, -- you may or may not be one of the unlucky ones for whom it fails!"
"7","5","This is absolutely the best “go to” cake you can have in your back pocket. Pick a flavor and go with it, pick a frosting and voila. I use this mostly for when I do strawberry shortcake. What I do different is I butter the pan well and then coat it with sugar. So when you take it out the cake is crusted with a lovely layer of sweetness. Then all you need is a dusting is powered sugar or a drizzling of some glaze. Add some freshly whipped cream and some strawberries and it’s the best!"
"7","5","This was very easy to make and came out wonderfully. I was looking for a nice simple recipe and this really delivered. I'd definitely use this one again. I followed it word for word, except I used almond extract because we'd just run out of vanilla and I hadn't noticed. Still came out very tasty."
"7","5","THE best white cake I've ever had! I've made this twice now and have had rave reviews both times. I used this recipe for my grandmother's 80th birthday cake and she told me that she wants me to make her another one for her Christmas present! To those who complain about it being like cornbread, I have to wonder if maybe your baking powder is bad? I had to throw out one cake because mine had expired. The cake didn't rise and it looked and tasted like cornbread. Problem solved after buying new baking powder! I added about 1/4 cup milk after reading the reviews, but other than that followed the recipe. This is a wonderful cake, thank you so much for sharing your recipe!"
"7","4","If you find this cake comes out too dense, whip your butter and sugar longer. Sometimes you can whip up to 15-20 min. Then add your other ingredients. This will make your cake light and fluffy"
"7","5","Very nice! I made this recipe 4 times with triple the ingredients each time and it was wonderful. Tripling this recipe makes about 4x9in rounds which is what I wanted. It was also a perfect fit for my kitchenaid mixer (5qt). I did cream the butter and sugar a full 8 minutes before starting to adding the eggs! I baked them at 325deg in a convection oven (since I had 4 pans going) and the time was still between 30 and 45 minutes. I also froze the cakes and they did get a little stiff from freezing (yes..after thawing) but it made for an easy cake to build with and was still a big hit. I also made one triple batch with 2 sleeves of crushed oreos tossed in before baking and WOW..that was awesome."
"7","4","I have been using this recipe for about 3 years now. It is really more yellow in color than white. If you want an excellent yellow cake use David's Yellow Cake!!! With a few changes this one can be 5 star add 1 Tablespoon Veg oil and change to 2 teaspoons baking powder and 3 eggs. The original version is a little dry for me. I like this best as cupcakes!"
"7","5","Totally awesome and super easy! I followed the exact recipe except I made mine rainbow by using gel food coloring, it came out amazing!"
"7","4","This is a very good white cake. I used 3/4 the amount of sugar and sifted the flour before mixing. I did add a bit more milk but I don't think it would have made much of a difference. I made this twice in a matter of days, one with strawberries and cream and the other with blueberries and cream. Delicious."
"7","5","EXCELLENT simple white cake. Perfect for cupcakes or layer cake. Variation: I added about 1/2 Tablespoon of finely grated lime zest, 2 Tablespoons of freshly squeezed lime juice and omitted the vanilla. I've also made it with lemon zest and lemon juice. Very fresh, lively taste with a moist, fluffy texture. I've made in more than a dozen times, with perfect results every time. Recommendation: Beat well after each egg, it really helps to make a wonderful texture. (I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the full cup because my frosting is sweet.)"
"7","1","For those of you who like a white cake to be light, fluffy, and/or moist, this is not the cake for you. It had the density/look of cornbread and was not very sweet either. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone or use it again."
"6","4","I was disappointed, it was bland and heavy. I am a experienced baker and followed the recipe. I am going to try again because it had so many great reviews. Next time I will try what others suggest and use 1/2 shortening. I will also double the vanilla or use lemon extract.  * I tried this cake again and discovered some tricks. use cake and pastry flour and sift it. The second time it came out light, fluffy and moist."
"6","5","it tasted really good! i don't think i beat or mixed it long enough because i was in a bit of a hurry so the cake came out a little dense. hopefully my next attempt will be perfect!"
"6","5","I believe this is my first review. Had to write. So simple that I literally prepared it in 5 minutes. Butter and sugar creamed with a handheld mixer - 1 minute. Cracked eggs one handed into mixer as beater beat - 30 seconds. Put the beater down to add vanilla - 10 seconds. Dumped flour/baking powder mixture in ALL AT ONCE - 1 minute. Dumped milk in - 30 seconds. Poured into Pam-sprayed and floured pan - 20 seconds. Ok - less than 5 minutes but you can use the excess minutes to mix dry mix and to powder your pan.  Toothpick tested at 30 minutes and it was ready!   RESULTS: I couldn't wait so I cut it immediately after pulling from oven and place a slice on my plate. AWESOME. I was very surprised at how good it was. I loved it. I will always use this recipe because it's SUPER FAST and super good. If you mess this up then boiling eggs might be a problem for you."
"6","1","This cake was terrible. For people who can hardly bake, this MIGHT be okay...and it is certainly simple. For people who do bake a lot, try a different recipe. This cake looks nice and it is moist (added milk) but not as moist as the recipes that I always make(my mother's)... The taste leaves much to be desired. I am shocked that this recipe has such high reviews."
"6","5","I just made this recipe, but having celeacs disease and being lactose-intolerence made it so I needed to make a few ajustments. For one I used almond milk instead of regular milk, and for two I used gluten-free rice flour. With most recipes it dosn't work with those changes, but with this one sure it does! I love it!"
"6","5","I found this recipe almost 4 years ago and it was so great, I have been making it again and again for birthday cakes. This recipe is awesome just the way it is. However, I recently tried a spin on it that brought it to an even higher level of wonderfulness. I added 1/3 cup of sour cream and substituted cream for the milk - so decadent!"
"6","5","Tasted great and we will make this again."
"6","5","I have literally tried a couple dozen vanilla cake recipes and this one is simply amazing! It's so tender and moist and light. I made sure to beat the butter, sugar, and eggs forever to ensure a light and moist cake. I will be making this again in a few days for a get together and I know my friends will love this cake!"
"6","1","These were not to my liking! I made them for my daughter's first grade birthday celebration at school with pink buttercream frosting. They looked great, but they smelled and tasted like corn muffins. The first grade class didn't like them much either. They licked the frosting off, complained that they smelled like corn. I was very embarrassed. It could have been something I did in preparing them I guess, but I do bake often and I made sure to follow the directions as written and to let the butter cream long enough. We won't be trying these again, and I will make sure to test future recipes before bringing them to school! : )"
"6","1","I tried this cake after reading a lot of good reviews. What a mistake!!! The cake turned baked very evenly and turned out light and fluffy which was good but it tasted awful. I will not ever make this cake again. It is a good thing that I tried this out before using it for a birthday cake!!!"
"6","4","I give this 4 stars - not as a birthday cake - but a great sweet cake. I made two cakes for my husband's birthday and let him choose which one he thought would make a better frosted birthday cake. He choose the 'Heavenly White Cake' (from this website). He said this cake was very good - but had a slight 'cornbread-like' consistency. I do agree - but don't let that stop you from making this VERY tasty cake. I would make cupcakes from it - but as a cake - think it would be the PERFECT cake to use as a base for Strawberry Shortcake!!! Will keep this recipe and use again - just not for a birthday cake application."
"6","5","This is going to be my go-to white cake whenever any recipe calls for white cake. This is AWESOME and no comparison for the package white cake mix. The cake is moist and absolutely delish! I followed the recipe as is and used the batter to make Sweetheart Cupcakes (by Celeste - recipe on this site). I made 18 cupcakes and they were gone in a flash. My cupcakes took about 24 mins to be completely done, and just for the record, I used brown eggs instead of white ones. Thanks a ton for sharing SCOTTOSMAN!! :)"
"6","1","I did not care for this recipe. i followed the recipe perfectly, but my cupcakes had the flavor and texture of dense pancakes. i was trying to make cute cupcakes for my friends for valentines day, and now i have nothing for them. i was very disappointed; i will not make this again."
"6","4","used this to make some cupcakes yesterday. and my mom loved it! :) used 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup and it turned out so goooood! also colored the mixture rainbow with wilton icing colors. see picture :)"
"6","5","perfect white cake!! very simple to modify, for example I have taken this as a base to what my family now calls 'Dee's Signature Chocolate cake' which I just melt down 1/2 bag (sometimes more) of semi sweet chocolate chips and mix in whipping cream and add that to the white cake mix"
"6","5","Can't believe this recipe only has an average of 4 stars. This is hands down the best white cake ever! I have made this DOZENS of times- as a white cake, for cupcakes, as a base for strawberry cake, base for muffins. etc... it is a fantastically rich, dense, moist cake. I don't see how anyone would ever have a problem with this recipe turning out. It has turned out perfectly for me every single time, one of those awesome recipes you know you can always count on!"
"6","4","I was craving something sweet but had limted ingreditions because i haven't went grocery shopping yet so i used what i had .And just to let you know this simple white cake was deelish. This recipe was simple and yet tasty.I did let the egg and butter get to room tempature i whip the heck out of the butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes.I sepearted the eggs and egg whites.So i beat the egg yolk for 2 addition minutes the mix should look verypale looking but fluffy.I didn't wanna used all milk so i used half cream cheese and half milk.I did have enough sugar but i thought it might not be sweet enough so i mixed 1 cup sugar with 1/2 cup confectioner sugar.i sifted the flour.I add 2tsp vanilla extract 1/2 tsp almond extract and i whipped the egg whites and folded it in the batter at the end. Great Simple White Cupcakes.."
"6","5","This cake is FABULOUS!! I substituted buttermilk for milk and made cupcakes. They were so moist and light and gone quickly. I can't wait to try it with a sheet cake."
"6","5","My 7 year old son loves to make this recipe and take it to school. All his classmates love it. It is light and fluffy, and very easy to make. It is absolutely delicious. We usually put a vanilla frosting on it. The recipe calls for 1/2 c. milk, but you may have to use a bit more, to smooth out the batter a little more."
"6","5","This is easily the best cake recipe I have. It was the first one I ever made from scratch & I havn't found one I like more yet. Simple, quick, & made with things you always have around anyway. One thing to note, although the title says 'white cake' it's really vanilla cake. Also, I don't recommend doubling it -- two seperate batches seem to come out better. This is a keeper...and we're *major* chocolate lovers!"
"5","3","This cake is good as is if you whip the eggs and butter long enough, but it could be better. I graduated pastry school and am always on the hunt for a perfect white cake- even in school we use a chiffon cake, which just isn't the same. I would suggest making the following changes: have ALL ingredients at room temperature. The batter will combine easier this way without overmixing. Whip the eggs in a bowl with a whisk first- until they are paler in color. Then add sugar. I also used 1/2 cup oil instead of butter- this makes it more tender since oil is liquid at room temperature and butter is solid at room temperature. Mix in the oil. Then add 3/4 cups buttermilk. Sift together the dry ingredients and add last. I used 1 3/4 cup cake flour instead of all purpose- it will be less 'cornbready'. Whatever you do, don't overmix after the flour is added. This will make it tough."
"5","5","I make a lot of cakes as a side business. I use a recipe for all my vanilla cupcakes that is almost exactly like this one. It is quite a heavy and dense cake though and I am making a wedding cake and was looking to have something a bit lighter. I didn't think that this recipe would be since it is all the same ingredients just different measurements, but I thought I'd give it a go. I followed the recipe exact except for two slight variations. I added 1/4 tsp of salt to take the sweet edge off and I sifted the dry ingredients to make the cake lighter. It work awesome. I doubled the recipe and got two 6' round cakes and 12 cupcakes (for my family to eat :) I am very pleased with this recipe. As the old saying goes, Out with the old...in with the new!!  NOTE: Be sure to NOT over mix your batter. Only mix until all ingredients are combined plus maybe an extra 30 at the end. I always use REAL vanilla extract. It cost 3x more then artificial vanilla, but makes a HUGE difference in the taste of any cake. Well worth the money spent. Use room temp eggs. This will help with the over all texture of the cake and again makes a huge difference in the quality of your final product."
"5","5","Made this cake for my daughters birthday. She wanted a teapot birthday cake, so I baked it in pyrex mixing bowls. Added a layer of frosting on the top of one of the bowls and inverted the 2nd cake upside down on top to make a teapot shape. Homemade marshmallows made a great handle and spout. Cake turned out amazing. I wanted something dense enough to hold together, and at first I was worried. But after putting the cake in the fridge for a bit, the crumb held together very nicely. Everyone thought it tasted amazing. I just used this recipe again today, and got what some of the other reviewers referred to as 'cornbread' texture. BUT I used freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of white... so I'm sure that was the reason. Perhaps I didn't beat it long enough too, who knows. It still tastes good, just not the same texture as before. I'll definitely play with it more, because this recipe is a keeper."
"5","5","This is my new cake recipe. It doesn't need anything and is perfect as is. If you aren't creaming your butter and sugar long enough, it will turn out grainy. If you aren't incorporating your eggs properly, the texture will be off. Follow the directions as written and you're golden. Like a previous poster said, if you end up with batter that looks like yellowish cool whip, you're doing it right. Now to find a decent frosting recipe...."
"5","5","This cake was absolutely scrumptious! It tasted more like a vanilla cake than white, but I absolutely love this cake!"
"5","5","This is a quick recipe to make. I was looking for a simple cupcake recipe for kindergarten class and this is it. It taste like a sugar cookie in a cupcake form."
"5","2","This was okay but it stuck to the bottom of the pan and was not very moist."
"5","5","I usually am a from-the-box cake maker around my house. Usually. I think this recipe is going to change that.  While I stuck to the recipe like glue, I have to make an addendum: unless you are using a standing mixer, the extra milk is needed. I slowly creamed the butter/sugar IN the mixer, added the eggs one at a time and waited until the first one was completely blended in when I added the other.  This recipe is so amazingly simple, but it requires patience. I love how soft the cupcakes came out and the taste is great. Just remember to BLEND the ingredients - it really should be about the consistency of cool whip, if not marshmallow-y.  Now, I have to figure out if I'm even going to bother icing these babies!!!"
"5","4","I made this with a few changes for allergy reasons and from other reviews. I added the extra 1/4c of milk and used 2 tablespoons of vanilla, I also had to use a gluten free flour (I used Jules Gluten Free all purpose flour) They turned out GREAT, and EXTRA fluffy not sure if it was the flour change or if it was because I filled my empty cupcake spots with water adding extra moisture to the oven. THANKS!!"
"5","5","I don't normally review recipes that I've changed, but I think this one is worth it. A friend made me margarita cupcakes for my birthday & I've been craving them ever since. I wanted to use this recipe (since I had no box mix) and make it into a margarita cake. I used less vanilla extract (not a huge fan of it). I made cake flour out of the all purpose and sifted several times, I replaced the milk with Jose Cuervo margarita mix. I always throw scratch mix cakes into the freezer before frosting (it had cooled a bit). I think it keeps them from drying out so much. Scratch cakes are naturally going to be dryer than box mixes (no preservatives). I topped it with a delicious lime cream cheese frosting. It's fantastic!"
"5","5","Favorite - Easiest - Most Versatile. This is my go-to vanilla cake recipe. I spent years trying to find a great white cake, years of recipes with buttermilk, sour cream, odd extracts, etc... No more searching. I found it."
"5","5","I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used margarine because it was late at night and that is what I had.  They turned out PERFECTLY!!! I had to make them to add to a batch of cupcakes for my son's birthday that I had made from a box but didn't have enough. So I looked for a recipe and this one looked good and easy.  My husband taste tested them and couldn't tell which one was from a box and which one was homemade. I will NEVER use a box again, but I will use this recipe and play with adding flavors, etc.  AMAZING recipe - not dry or heavy like a pancake at all!! TOtally light and fluffy and delicious!!!"
"5","5","I am a white cake snob - I admit it. I was doubtful, but wanted a quick easy recipie to put together with my kids. This was quick, easy and delicious! I had read the posts about increasing the milk and mixing well. I did both (we just left the mixer on even while measuring the ingredients - the 3-year-old was in charge of turning the bowl) and it turned out moist and fluffy. We even substituted splenda to a great success. Today we substituted lite cocount milk and added 1/2cup of shredded coconut. Excellent! THis is a great recipie to experiment with."
"5","3","It was a very easy cake recipe to follow and put together. However, the cake itself came out very dry despite having to add 1/2 cup extra of milk."
"5","3","Tastes good, but I don't know why, maybe the baking powder proportion is out of whack, but each time I make this cake as cupcakes it browns too quickly and over flows the cups. I tried filling the cups less than half full, and they still got all the way to the top and then some. I'm going to try with only one tsp of baking soda and then update, but I don't make cupcakes everyday..."
"5","5","fantastic!! I increased the milk to 3/4 cup as suggested. They stay light and airy if you cream the sugar/butter/eggs really well and then only mix sparingly once the flour is added."
"5","2","I gave this recipe two tries, thinking that maybe I did something wrong the first time. Sorry, I did not like it at all. It tastes too dry and dense and bland. I doubt I will be making it again."
"5","5","simple and delicious! I will make again!"
"5","5","An amazing white cake! I must say, I'm a chocolate cake kind of a person but I thought this might be an interesting cake to try and I followed some of the other reviewers on adding extra milk and vanilla and it was amazing! So good! My boyfriend really doesn't even like white cake but was devouring this one!"
"5","4","I followed this recipe exact, and while the cake tasted very very good, for some reason, my cupcakes rose up and over the tops of the pan, then spread out thin and flat. It was a mess to clean up, and I ended up throwing them in the trash. I only filled the cups about half-way, so I have no idea what went wrong. Might be worth trying again some day."
"5","5","Excellent cake. 'Simple' is the way to go for white cake. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and followed the other reviewers' suggestion of an extra bit of milk. This will be my go-to recipe for white cake from now on."
"5","5","This cake is awsome, I made it for my boyfreinds birthday and everyone loved it. I only made a couple changes after reading a handful of reveiws and those adding more milk and follwing the directions. I also made it into a marble cake... I took about a cup of the cake batter and added 3 heaping TBS of cocao powder and mixed it up really well the added to the batter in the pan. I made a chocolate buttercream frosting to put on top and it tastes sooooo good! I would totally recomend it!"
"5","5","wonderful! ate all of them almost within hours. I'm a cake lover, these are better than the martha stewart white cake."
"5","5","This cake was easy & perfect! I added the extra 1/4 cup milk people suggested. I also did 1 tsp or vanilla & 1 tsp almond, just to add a subtle change in flavor. Use a mixer if you have one. I will keep this as a 'I need a cake at the last minute' recipe."
"5","4","I found this cupcake to be good really. Like other reveiwers I added 30 ml extra milk. The taste was good except that I think I overbaked the cupcakes a tad (no fault of the recipe though). I would make it again for sure."
"5","5","I doubled the recipe to make 24 delicious cupcakes. This recipe is the absolute best. I sifted the unbleached all-purpose flour, used 1.5 cups of superfine sugar, and whipped the eggs with the vanilla until light and frothy. I poured unsweetened vanilla Almond Breeze (in place of milk) into the egg/vanilla mixture before beating the wet into the dry. For an extra touch, I stuck a sliver of Lindt orange chocolate into the middle of the cupcake prior to baking. Topped with chocolate fudge frosting... decadent."
"5","5","This was the very first totally from scratch cake I've ever made. I won't be going back to box after this it was moist and so tasty. My kids even loved it they keep begging me to make another one. I just might."
"5","5","Ok, this is the best white cake I have ever tried. For taste, a 5. for texture, a 5, for simplicity, a 5. for it not sticking, a 5. Seriously, if this didnt come out for you your probably doing something wrong. the only thing I did different was to add 2 tablespoons of milk.  I beat the heck out of the butter and sugar (5 min), then out of my eggs (3 min after each)I used a wooden spoon to mix in the vanilla, premixed the flour and baking powder and sifted it into the batter gently stirring it. then gently stirred in the milk until well combined and smooth. it will not be either too thin or too thick and have a light yellow color. I baked the cupcakes 17 minutes until they were golden on the top. the texture is moist and light but not too moist or too light and has a lightly crunchy top. dont fill the cupcake papers too much (only 3/4) because it rises a bit.  this is the only cake i will use from now on and just in case anyone wants to know it is very similar to the cake used in magnolias bakery (i have never tried it, but the recipe is almost exactly the same and I know it is a very famous bakery in the u.s) thank you so much for a great cake recipe !! Oh! and im not trying to say that you copied the recipe.. im just trying to say that a very well known bakery uses a similar recipe :) I know people here tend to make attacks to people that submit famous recipes or that are similar, thats not my intention.. Update: i made this again with margarine and used 3/4 cup milk. it mu"
"5","1","The cake was soo heavy and I had to cook it twice as long to get the center to cook. And I followed the recipe exactly."
"5","3","The taste was great, but the cake itself was so heavy and the longer it sat the worse it got. I have Kitchen Aid mixer and I mixed this for quite some time. My batter looked like yellowish 'cool whip' like some suggested it should, but it still turned out horrible."
"5","5","Wow! You can go either way with this recipe!! I normally use this when I need a simple cake, but this time I also used pineapples and some sprinkles and the result was a great pineapple cake. Great texture, very soft and....gone before I knew it haha! I have a picture so you can see how it looked like!"
"5","5","The votes are in and my DH and my kids all said this cake was great. I scaled it to make 18 servings (1 1/2 recipes), used 1 cup of milk in total and baked it in a 9x13' pan. I found it quick and easy to prepare and resulted in a nice pale yellow colored cake, close textured but still ahd a nice light crumb. It will be great in the summertime split and filled with fresh berries! Yum! I can't wait!"
"5","2","Cake was too hard when cooled."
"5","5","GRRAAAAEEEEAAATTTT CAKE! TURNED OUT JUST PERFECT. I made cupcakes instead of one big cake...i also devided the batter in half and added cocoa to one half, then i swirled the two halves together! TURNED OUT SUPERB! THNX FOR THE RECIPE!  Sam A."
"4","5","Incredible recipe. I made it for a business anniversary event, and it was a total hit; I even had people who claimed to not like cake commenting on how good it was! Even better, it stays moist even in the worst of circumstances -- due to a packed week, I had to make it a whole 4 days before the event, and it was STILL awesome! (Frosted it and wrapped tightly with saran wrap.) I wouldn't recommend that, but it does speak to the greatness of this cake. I didn't change any ingredient amounts. I'll be making this for years to come. Thank you!"
"4","5","Awesome recipe, been using for a few years but instead of 1/2 a cup of milk i use 1 cup so it isn't dry:)"
"4","5","I make this cake all the time! It always comes out so fluffy and moist. The key is creaming together the butter and sugar for about 10 minutes with my Kitchenaid Professional Mixer. And then when I add the eggs, I beat for another 8-10 minutes. Thank you for this recipe. This is a staple in my home!"
"4","5","i make cakes for a living and this is the recipe i use, hands down, everytime, and well since i am making more cakes the ever before, and getting nothing but compliments, well i would say its a keeper!!!!!!!"
"4","2","I give this 2 stars because I am sure part of this was my own fault, it must have been. This cake was dry and gritty. Yes, it did slightly resemble the flavor of a sugar cookie but it was pretty aweful and I LOVE sugar cookies. I am glad that others enjoyed this and kudos for a new recipe but I just wanted a 'Simply White Cake.'"
"4","2","The cake came out... sticky. It was very hard to put into a pan and it was not fluffy when done. the taste was good enough, but I was disappointed overall."
"4","5","Easy to whip up and very tasty. I used the batter to make 12 Pineapple Upside Down cupcakes. Cute and yummy."
"4","5","I am trying to get into cake baking to start baking my own bday cakes and have been looking for a cake recipe, this is the 1st one I tried and loved it! The only thing I did differently was instead of 1 tbs of vanilla the original recipe called for, I used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla @ 1 1/2 tsp almond extract. (Only bcuz I wanted a lil different taste to my cake). The cake came out absolutly delicious!! Very moist and not 'cornbread texture' or 'dense' like other reviewers have stated. If I hadn't made this myself, I would've thought it was a box cake, that's how moist & soft it was!! Thanks for the recipe. This is a keeper & I will look no further!"
"4","4","I took the advice of other reviews and made sure I mixed really well as I added ingredients one by one. Also, I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup more of milk. It was a little more dense that I would have liked, but it tasted good. I agree that it tastes like a sugar cookie."
"4","2","the taste was good...but i followed the recipe exactly and it didn't rise at all. it looked more like a pancake than a cake."
"4","5","I used this recipe about a week ago to make cupcakes, they were good, but a little dry. So after reading lots of reviews I made the following tweeks:  Used 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup Add a pack of vanilla instant pudding/pie filling to the dry flour mixture Used 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract instead of 2 teaspoons Made sure ALL my items were at room temp (milk & eggs) I creamed my butter before adding the sugar and then creamed them together for about 10 minutes in my mixer. I filled my cupcake cups almost full and baked for 20 minutes. I also added a pinch of salt to the flour mixture  Ya'll I just tasted one before I put the frosting on and they are DELISH!!! Soooo moist! I will never buy box cake again!  I also added food coloring bc my daughter wanted purple and blue cupcakes for her birthday and the cake mix took to the food coloring very well!!!!"
"4","1","Dry as a British Sitcom. This recipe, when followed exactly, produces a very dry, dense, and mealy cake - I suppose the people who gave it high ratings either like dry cake OR modified the recipe to make it more moist. Even with delicious buttercream frosting this cake was a bust. It also didnt rise sufficiently so my cake was short :(. This recipe 'as is' is awful."
"4","5","Love this recipe! It is not fluffy, it is firm and easy to decorate since there weren’t a lot of crumbs. It reminds me of my grandma but mom says she never made anything but fluffy cakes! I’m gonna keep making this and think of grandma anyway! I did use Burnt Butter Frosting with this one time and it is good too."
"4","4","Needs a matching white icing recipe attached :)"
"4","5","Best cupcake I have had in a long time! Mine were light and fluffy, probably because of what other reviewers suggested... creaming the butter and sugar for 8-10 minutes. It may seem like a lot, but it's worth it. They did taste similar to a sugar cookie, but that was not a bad thing at all. The only issue I had was that the cupcakes were rather flat. They spread out a little too much on the tops, so I had to cut some of the edges off... and this was even when I made 17 cupcakes instead of 12. Overall, this is a really good cupcake/cake, and it makes more than I needed... which was a bonus! Great recipe, it is highly reccomended by my whole family."
"4","5","It was my first time to bake cake, and this turned out perfect!! im so proud of myself. I am also thankful!! my husband was licking the smell of that cake ;)"
"4","2","I agree with some of the other reviewers-this does kinda taste like sugar cookies. My problem was that I prefer cakes a little sweeter, and with a fluffier texture."
"4","5","I give this 5 stars my whole family and I loved it, it was very moist and sprang to touch. I followed the recipe exactly and made cupcakes. :p"
"4","5","Excellent and so easy. THANKS!"
"4","4","I think this is missing salt. I added some & it was an improvment."
"4","5","Like other reviewers, I added extra milk and upped the vanilla to one tablespoon. I also sifted the flour and baking powder. Recipe made 13 cupcakes. Very delicious!"
"4","5","ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!! Made a double batch this morning. :O) So easy and delish!! I added PeanutButter Chips to the last tray and they are really good too! :O) THANK YOU for such an easy delish recipe!!"
"4","1","It tasted like cornbread"
"4","4","very nice and simple. made them as cupcakes, i liked the density."
"4","5","I would really give this 4 and a half stars because it is almost fabulous, but something is missing, i just can't put my finger on what. I made the recipe exactly as directed and it came out great for children's cupcakes. I will definately keep this for a base cupcake recipe."
"4","3","This was just ok, nothing spectacular like I expected by reading the other reviews. It was a little dry even after adding extra milk. I would rather have a box cake!"
"4","4","Simply delicious! I added a bit more milk like the others suggested and was glad for it. My only qualm was that the cupcakes harden within the day so they are best eaten the day they are baked."
"4","4","This recipe worked wonderfully. I had a last minute catering order and needed fluffy white cake quickly. I had this recipe saved, so I pulled it out.  At first, when following it to the letter, the batter was super thick, more like brownie batter. So I added an extra 1/4c milk, and it was perfect.   Light and fluffy, not overly sweet, and spongy.   I made mini cupcakes with mine, and they rose beautifully. Thanks!"
"4","5","The first time I made this, as written, the batter looked too thick for a cake, so I followed other reviewers advice & added more milk-about 1/4 c. more. I also beat everything thoroughly at each step. The resulting batter resembled coolwhip in fluffiness. The cake had a nice crumb & was plenty moist & delicious. I now prefer to substitute 3/4 c. buttermilk for the 1/2 c. milk which ups the moistness, though tends to crack the top of the cake-not a problem for me since I turn my cakes out onto a plate to frost & serve. I have also had no problems adding gel food color &/or using different flavorings with this cake. The smaller size is very appreciated as well, since it's just my DH & myself here now."
"4","3","It was tough coming up with the perfect review for this recipe. I have been searching everywhere for the perfect white cake recipe. This recipe has a YUMMY taste & really does remind you of a sugar cookie, however the appearance just is not appealing to me. They didn't necessarily fall, but they dont keep their shape once out of the oven. I am a cupcake expert and when using this recipe I was hoping for a puffy cupcake, didnt happen though. Despite trying 4 variations to make them rise, i just couldnt do it. If you will be covering it with lots of frosting then this is a good recipe, if you care about appearance then it doesnt work out so well. My advice for that perfect cupcake, use the recipe on this site for crazy chocolate cake, just do not add the cocoa and add more vanilla oh and use about another 1/4 cup of flour to make up for the baking cocoa. I also added a little almond extract for flavor."
"4","4","I used cake flour instead of all-purpose but that's the only variation. I should have listened to other reviewers and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk because it was a little dry. This recipe is ripe for variations though! I think I'll add some orange zest and pecans to it next time. I can't wait!"
"4","5","This was a great recipe to use for cupcakes for my daughter's birthday, the cake itself is incredibly moist. It's heavy, but not as heavy as a pound cake. Definitely tastes homemade and not like a box cake...."
"4","5","Very nice, simple recipe. I experimented with my convection oven and found that for cupcakes they baked best at 325 for 15-17 minutes. You really need to know your oven and adjust baking times and temps accordingly. Thank you for a great recipe!"
"4","5","Made this for my birthday! It was delicious!"
"4","5","Followed the recipe exactly. And the cake was light moist and delicious. Made cupcakes. Got 18 regular"
"4","5","My boyfriend loved this cake! He said it was better than wedding cake (his fav). I sifted all the dry ingredients & added nearly 1 cup of milk. I think my secret ingredient was: 1 tsp of coconut extract. YUMMY! It's light and fluffy and I dont think i'll have any to take to the office...we're probably going to eat it all today."
"4","5","I used this recipe to make a 6 layered rainbow cake. I made 2 batches and separated each batch into thirds for coloring and baked in a 9' round pan. (I did cut the baking time down to 20 minutes which was perfect) This cake came out AMAZING! it was the first time I made a cake from scratch and I am sorry I didnt find this recipe a long time ago! I can't wait to try it again, maybe next time with lemon extract instead of vanilla..."
"4","1","It was a very heavy cake.. will try again with a diff recipe."
"4","3","For a homemade white cake this recipe was ok. I felt like it tasted a little bland and a little bit like corn bread. I don't know if I'll make it again. The texture was perfect however. I just made sure to beat the heck out of each step and I also added a little extra vanilla."
"4","5","Excellent just made this last night doubled the recipe, made about 27 cupcakes ... DELICIOUS ... i also added about 1/8 cup milk as advised by many of the reviews ... it was perfect with cream cheese frosting and sprinkles!!! Very moist and fluffy."
"4","5","I added almond extract as well and it turned out excellent. Moist and I served it with mixed berries over top plus whipping cream."
"4","1","this did not work at all, the batter ended up way to thick"
"4","5","I halved this recipe and I ended up with 8 overflowing cupcakes! No bother, they are very sweet and do not even need frosting. I didn't use a mixer but I tried to stir everything as much as possible to avoid any denseness issues and my cupcakes are great. They are light and airy taste great, if not a bit too sweet. I added a 1/3 cup of nonfat milk (based off of other reviews to add more and I only had nonfat). Very good!"
"4","5","I made this cake exactly as posted. Topped it with homemade chocolate fudge butter cream frosting. It was great. My friend (it was her birthday cake) loved it too. I didn't have any of the negative issues posted by other reviewers. The flavor and texture were delicious. The portion is small. I only had an 8x8 pan and it was just the right size. Would suggest doubling the recipe for a layer cake or larger portion needs. Will make again soon!"
"4","5","This cake has the best texture of any homemade cake I've made. Most cakes turn out dry, but this one is light, and soft with a good flavor. Make sure to follow the directions exactly using an electric mixer to whip up the batter real well."
"4","2","I thought is was ok,it was to dry for my liking and i will not be making this again"
"4","4","Good flavor but was really difficult to get out of the muffin tins. Make sure you grease and flour your pan well!"
"4","5","Delicious! Thank you."
"4","5","WONDERFUL! I subbed 1 tsp of orange zest for the vanilla and made 1/2 cup milk into 1/4 cup fresh squeezed OJ and 1/4 cup milk. Made it a yummy orange cake and I'm topping it with orange buttercream! Pics up when it all comes together!"
"4","4","Doubled this recipe and it made well over 2 dozen large cupcakes. Although I really don't mind a dense cake, I followed other's advice and beat the sugar and butter mixture for several minutes until light and creamy. Cakes came out very light and fluffy. Also added extra milk and vanilla. Thought the actual flavor was okay, a little bland. However it was a perfect balance when teamed with the sweetness of buttercream."
"4","5","I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I double the recipe for two 9' rounds (made a layer cake) using a total of 1 1/2 c milk (as others recommended adding 1/4 cup more). The cake is tasty, moist and dense. As another reviewer said - like wedding cake. Simple and delicious!"
"4","5","I managed to successfully make my 1st cake ever using this very simple but extremely delicious recipe! I used this recipe to make a Green Tea Cake. It was incredibly moist & so so so yummy! I think it's partly because I used condensed milk instead of the regular milk so it made it moister. I loved it, my parents loved it, even my dogs loved it!!! I am going to use this same recipe to make a Carrot Cake."
"4","5","If you are looking for a white cake, color-wise, this is not the recipe for you. However, if your primary concern is taste, look no more, for this is extraordinary. Following the advise of other reviewers, I did increase the milk by 1/8 cup (and probably could have added as much as 1/4 cup more) and I put in a full tablespoon of vanilla. It's a hit."
"4","5","I loved this. I made cupcakes for Halloween and put black icing on them. I added a bit extra vanilla and a bit extra milk as recommended by other. Loved it!"
"4","4","Nice basic white cake. I added 1.5 tablespoon sprinkles to get 'confetti' cupcakes. Recipe make an even dozen cupcakes which is just enough for nearly any occasion without becoming a temptation. Make sure you really beat the butter and sugar fill fluffy to get a tender cake."
"4","1","I thought this cake was dry and tasteless! I followed others reviews thinking it would improve it! I don't NOT recomend!!!"
"4","5","Very good recipe. This cake has a wonderful taste it really isn't the best cake to use for decorating but it has a wonderful taste and is super easy to make. I made it as is but I softened the butter first and sifted the flour. I think that changes the texture that other reviewers were complaining about. My boys ate the whole cake in one sitting without frosting. If you are adding frosting you should probably use less sugar."
"4","5","Since the reviews were so mixed I was hesitant to make this cake, but I went ahead because I was low on butter. To my surprise this cake has a wonderful wedding cake flavor! Mine came out great - I did really beat the batter for each step and I did sift my dry ingredients. I made it in a 8X9 pan and it really is just a fantastic cake! It really is very easy to frost also like mentioned in other reviews."
"4","5","I was worried about making this cake this morning, with so many negative reviews about the cake being very dry and dense and needing more than 1/2 cup milk. I followed the receipe and had more milk ready just in case I needed more. After putting in the 1/2 cup milk, it was so super smooth, there was no reason to add more milk. That surprised me after what I read about the batter needing more milk. I made cupcakes, so, when they cooled off, I had one so that I could finish this review, it was the most perfect, moist cupcake I ever ate!! I really don't understand how so many people can have different opinions, so, don't let this receipe scare away a new 'baker' that wants to try this cake! Only different thing I did was use egg whites since I can't have yolks and used Lataid milk since I can't have dairy. Perfect cupcakes!!"
"4","5","I took other reviewers tips on whipping the butter and sugar together for about 5 minutes, adding the eggs one at a time and mixing very, very thoroughly. I used 3/4 cup milk and it is the perfect soft vanilla flavor with a great crumb and light texture. Thank you for the recipe Scottosman~"
"4","5","It is sooooooooo delicious! I added more milk (about 1/4 of a cup) and i also added a couple drops of lemon but it you couldn't taste it. This is an wonderful cake to make!!!! Tip: Make it on Father's Days!! :-) And yes Vanilla Extract is the same as Vanilla Essence"
"4","4","a little eggy tasting possibly more vanilla."
"4","1","this was easy to make, but i didn't like the way it tasted. it was also a little dry!!"
"4","4","It was ok. I was making sure I bean the batter well, but still I guess it wasn't enough ..."
"4","5","This was very moist. I mixed it for a long time as suggested by others."
"4","1","I loved the idea of this recipe. I tend to like a less sweet cake. Full disclosure: I made mini cupcakes and cut the recipe to 1/4 of the serving size. It was indeed a white cake. Looked like cornbread and had a similar consistency. Disappointed. Didn't like it at all. :("
"4","5","I thought this was a great simple white cake :) I did add the extra 1/4 cup of milk,beat the butter and sugar for 9 minutes, sifted the dry ingredients 2 times, and mixed each step for about 2-3 minutes and it turned out great."
"4","5","I made this cake (in 2 round pans)and iced it with 'best buttercream frosting' recipe from this site. It tasted like wedding cake. there is a slight sweetness to the cake which was excellent and you don't get in box mixes. It is a little more dry than box mix, but that adds to the homemade texture and it tastes better this way - like real cake - you wouldn't even call it dry if you weren't used to cakebox mixes. My husband loved it - best cake he has had and for better or for worse, the two of us had no difficulty eating up both cakes (I mase it twice)...a little too fast. (I don't use anything w/alcohol so I substituted the vanilla extract with a little lemon juice and put some in the icing too which gave it just the slightest citrus flavor and made the cake/icing taste gourmet and very delicious.)"
"4","2","I was really hoping for a light, fluffy white cake recipe, and this wasn't it. I made cupcakes and they turned out very dense. The flavor is not very good either."
"4","5","For what it is supposed to be, this is a great recipe. It is simple to make, and tastes very good. I followed directions and had no problems at all with the texture or rise of this cake. I will be keeping this recipe for the express purpose of experimenting with it. It's a great starter cake for fruit fillings, different frostings, variations on a theme....experimenting is what's fun about baking after all! Thank you for this recipe! It's a keeper!"
"4","5","Fluffy and Nice! The dough was to die for! I added a little more milk, adout 1/4 cup"
"4","3","Unless you are making cupcakes or using the 9X9 pan, you probably need to double the batter. The cake turned out okay, but not so good the next day. It wasn't very moist, more dense and slightly dry."
"4","1","I followed the recipe and several of the reviewers suggestions to make these cupcakes better but still didn't get good outcome. I even made sure that my batter was a yellow cool whip like consistincy but when they came out of the oven they tasted like corn bread! I don't understand how with a recipe like this it can end up tasting like corn bread? I will NOT be making these again."
"4","5","So moist and yummy! I added an additional 1/4 C of milk, 1 T of vanilla and 1/4 t of salt and made mini cupcakes. Delicious...I don't see how I can ever make a box cake mix again. Very easy and all the ingredients can be found in every kitchen."
"4","4","I made cupcakes with this recipe. I was disapointed because they were very dry. I should have looked at the reviews BEFORE I made the recipe. I think I might try it again with more milk next time."
"4","4","i just made this recipe, seems to have turned out well. instead of cow's milk, i used soy milk. only used 1/2 cup and it worked fine. tastes great."
"4","4","I made it several times ... I was most pleased using the following modifications for cupcakes: using just under 1 cup organic whole milk, I added one egg white in addition to the two whole eggs, 1 Tablespoon of Vanilla and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. They came out moist and dense! I baked them for 20 minutes only, just right. I agree that icing them pulls pieces off. So, I decided to fill a pastry bag with icing and do it that way! Perfect! Will definitely make them again! Thank you."
"4","5","BEAUTIFUL!!!  i baked it with 2 kids ( age 7 & 6), i was babisitting. it so so simple, but tasted GREAT!!! we put a little lime juice in it. and we made a lime glaze to go on top!! it was a hit!! they wouldnt stop begging me for a slice.....it was hilarious. now there is onlt 1/8 of the cake left, lol!!"
"4","5","This is a great recipe that I have used MANY times to make cupcakes. One batch usually has multicoloured sprinkles with vanilla or strawberry frosting (so when kids bite into them, there are flecks of colour through them!); and to the other I add 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder and an extra 3 tablespoons of milk as well as a packet of choc chips. I also use half the amount of sugar which is something I do with all sweet recipes from this site, but that's because I'm an Aussie and we generally have less sugar in our foods. (I've even come across this bit of trivia in a recipe book - I swear it's not just me!!). Thanks for the great recipe!"
"4","4","I loved the corn bread taste to it! :] But, the first time I made it, it almost burnt. It might have been because I left it in there too long, I put in the wrong ingredient, or the pan I used might have been too small and burnt the sides. But, when I made it the second time, I made sure I used the right ingredients, put it in a bigger pan and reduce the temperature to 320 [just in case] and let it cook slowly so it wouldn't burn the sides again. It came out great the second time! =D [Hope that might have helped anyone having problems with this recipe.]"
"4","1","This recipe was incredibly disappointing. Even with an extra 1/2 cup of milk, these came out very dense, more like muffins than cupcakes. The amount of sugar and vanilla in them isn't sufficient, either. I definitely WON'T be making these again."
"4","5","basic, great tasting white cake with a thousand possibilites. And you probably have everything already in the house."
"4","1","The cake has no flavor, and turned out dry."
"4","5","WOW! So moist and mouthwatering. I took some suggestions from other reviewers and used 3/4 c. milk and added an extra 1/4 c. sugar. Perfect. The best from-scratch white cake I have ever made. No sweat and all enjoyment!"
"4","4","I had to leave it in the oven for a few minuets longer, and also added some extra milk (maybe about an extra 1/4C) because the batter seemed too thick. Turned out delicious though - nice and dense like a cake from the bakery. No more box mixes for me. Note: Goes well with the 'Butter Cream II' recipe."
"4","5","This was an excellent recipe. After reading the reviews, I added an extra egg. The cake was moist, light and enhaled by my family. As a topping I used 2 packages of DreamWhip and poured in one small box of Orange Jello. The topping tasted like a Creamsicle!!! Oh so yummy. Thanks for sharing your great recipe."
"4","5","This is the *only* white cake recipe I use to make cupcakes. I use cake flour and use sour cream instead of milk and they turn out light & fluffy, hold together well (good crumb), and are moist and flavourful."
"4","1","This was the worst, driest cake I have ever made or tasted. I do not recommend this unless you add oil to moisturize it."
"4","4","Made for my daddy on Father's Day...he likes/loves cupcakes. These went so fast that I almost didn't get one...I do have a large family..lol. I did add a bit more milk (per the advice of several of the reviewers). Went great with my french vanilla cream cheese icing. Thanks for the post."
"4","5","I used this recipe to make my friend's wedding cake. It baked very evenly, and was a dream to work with. I used 4 times the recipe, and made two 10 inch, two 8 inch, and two 6 inch layers. I used a lemon sugar syrup on the layers for added moistness, and filled with a raspberry mousse. It was delicious."
"4","5","i added big chunks of chocolate to it, and it was fab warm out of the oven, with the little hidden pockets of melted chocolate. a keeper, can't wait to experiment with other fillings! thanks for sharing =)"
"4","2","This cake was very simple, as indicated, but did not taste very good. It tasted more like corn bread. Luckily, I had frosting to make it taste better. I will not ever use this recipe again."
"4","3","I was a little disappointed with how this recipe turned out because the batter seemed so promising. I used a food processor and the batter was light and fluffy, but the resulting cupcakes, while they looked nice, were a little bland. They weren't as rich as I was expecting. Icing helps, though!"
"4","1","It's horrible."
"4","1","I don't know why but these were awful. It was easy to make and looked great when they came out, but they were hard, dry, plain, and had a bad texture. Sorry, but I'll NEVER make these again."
"3","5","I was looking for a white cake recipe to make pineapple upside down cake (and iv never made it before) and I have this a try... It was awesome!!! As I preheated the oven I put 1/3 cup of Margerine in the pan (9x13) and put it in the oven to melt, once it was melted I mixed the Margerine with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and put the pineapple rings on top... I made the cake batter as directed, but added a splash of orange juice( I didn't have pineapple juice) and poured the batter on top of the pineapple rings and baked as directed... So yummy! Moist, not too heavy and the pineapples caramelized perfectly!"
"3","5","This cake is GREAT!! I added the extra vanilla and milk as suggested. Perfect cupcakes and perfect cake!! Not a single complaint!! :) Thank you!!"
"3","4","This cake was very tasty but not quite moist enough for me. After increasing the milk to 3/4 cup and still not feeling satisfied, I decided to replace the milk with 3/4 cup of half & half. I even experimented and added 1/4 cup of 'whipped' cream cheese!!! What a difference!!! I used this recipe for cupcakes as well( baked@ 325°). My son, who is my biggest critic, was eating them before I could get them frosted. They just melt in your mouth!!!!"
"3","5","Excellent simple white/yellow cake. I did make a few adjustments based on previous user comments and from my first attempt at making this cake. On my first endeavor Itthought the cake was too dry and heavy. I realize no w that I beat the cake batter too much once I adde d the flour. That is a mistake I will not repeat. Here are my changes for your consideration:  3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup butter, 3 eggs. I left the flour, vanilla and milk portions as the original recipe stated. Also, I made the butter, eggs and milk were at room temperature. I creamed the butter and sugar in my KitchenAid mixer for probably a good five minutes. Then, when I added the eggs I continued to mix/beat for another five minutes. After I sifted the flour and baking powder together I changed the mixer attachment to the large paddle. I added the flour, making sure my mixer was on the slowest speed. I removed the bowl from the stand and used a wooden spoon to gently fold in the milk. Finally, it was time to bake the cake in a 325 degree preheated oven. I was pleased at how moist the cake turned out. I hope this was helpful!"
"3","5","best white cake I have ever tasted always so moist its so yummy I love this recipe. I've used this recipe about a hundred times always great perfect."
"3","5","I followed the recipe exactly. It made 18 cupcakes; they were moist and had good flavor. They were so good, my husband ate them warm, no frosting."
"3","2","I hate it when people write these heated, rude reviews when they dislike something. It seems so negative! I'm just going to be honest. I baked this cake for my husband's birthday, and since the ratings were so stellar, I expected big things.   I didn't overbake, I followed the recipe exactly. The cake turned out extremely dense (not always a bad thing), and DRY... bad combination. He ate it, the flavor wasn't bad and I didn't taste too much baking powder in the after bite, which is positive... but the consistency of the cake was not at all what I envisioned. It was extremely dry and thick.  I would try adding extra milk or perhaps a tiny bit more butter to help things out if you're going to go with this recipe. Try it first before you serve it at a gathering or an important event. The cake was pretty OK once I microwaved it and ate it warm... but who does that at a birthday party?   At any rate, I usually go with what most people say, and I was surprised that I disliked the recipe. This is NO offense at all to the creator, and again I'm not some jerk trying to bad mouth a recipe. Just being honest!"
"3","5","this worked out even better than I imagined. More milk would have made it more moist, but the taste was phenomenal! I will always use this recipe now."
"3","5","Lovely and simple!!"
"3","5","I was looking for a cake recipe that only made a 9x9 cake,as I was doing a practice run with marshmallow fondant(for a birthday next month)and I came upon this recipe.I tried soley for the fact it made a single layer.And wow! This was great!! It came out tasting and being the texture of poundcake. we LOVED it!! It tastes great on its own without any icing too! I followed what some other reviewers said and beat the batter till it looked like yellow cool whip. It was perfect!! hubby asked for this to be his birthday cake next month!"
"3","5","Wow! I made this last night and I followed the suggestions from other reviews and added 1/4 cup more milk and I beat it from start to finish so that it looked like yellow cool whip when I poured it into the pan. I topped it with the Orange juice frosting from the Frosted Orange Chiffon Cake recipe here and it was fabulous! This cake literally melted in my mouth and hubby made yum yum noises the whole time he was eating it. Excellent basic white cake recipe. Going to try for cupcakes next! :)"
"3","5","I haven't made a scratch cake in ages; this one is really great, easy and tastes wonderful. I doubled the recipe for a two layer cake and added an extra teaspoon of almond flavoring - yum Someone said the batter had a cornmeal consistency; they must not have creamed the sugar and butter/eggs long enough; batter should be creamy, have substance, and be pale yellow in color."
"3","5","Best cake I've ever eaten! I'm a very picky cake eater, and I've made this cake several times and never had a dud! Simple recipe too. Didn't change a thing and it turns out amazing. Look for a simple buttercream frosting and it's a perfect match!"
"3","5","These were absolutely divine. I found them sufficiently moist with a good density--not too heavy, but not too light. Whatever frosting you put on these, be sure it's not a heavy-flavored one; this is a cake with subtle, delicious flavors, and it'd be a real shame if they were all covered up! I will definitely make these again, and again, and again, and again..."
"3","5","Wonderful recipe for a white cake. Just made this the first time. However, i did use margarine instead of butter. Cream the sugar and margarine very well, until fluffy,. About 5-6 minutes. Followed rest of recipe as written. Poured into a heart shaped pan and baked for 35 minutes. Turned out perfect. Nice sweet tasting cake. Frosted the cake with a homemade cherry-vanillla frosting. Terrific. Will definitely make this cake more than once. Next time will try to add a flavored extract to it and food coloring for a new experimental cake."
"3","4","excellent and easy recipe. I substituted coconut milk for the regular milk and it was extremely moist and delicious. yummy."
"3","5","Great recipe! Perfect for beginners.  I used cane sugar and a bit of brown sugar instead of the white - and used 3/4 cup instead. It turned out delicious!  I also made a lemon glaze with lemon rind, juice, water and icing sugar which gave the cake a great flavor. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely recommend it."
"3","3","I didn't think this tasted very good, and it was very dry. I made cupcakes and I won't be using this recipe again."
"3","5","i used this recipe to make rainbow cake. texture was great. as i just use whipped cream (no added sugar) to layer the cakes...the sweetness in this recipe was just right. i did add 1/4 cup more of milk. will do it again. thanks for sharing the recipe and tips!"
"3","5","I love this recipe. I have made it many times. On special occasions I double the recipe and sub buttermilk for the milk. I add two extra teaspoons of vanilla and it turns out fantastic. I pour the batter into 2 9' rounds and make a layer cake."
"3","1","I followed this recipe EXACTLY for Cupcakes; twice. I was very disappointed in the taste, they tasted like Cornbread - both times. I did some searching and most of the 'corrections' said to use Cake Flour instead of All-Purpose. I bought some Cake Flour and changed a few other ingredients and they turned out AMAZING."
"3","5","Yes- it is like a pound cake sugar cookie. So it gets 5 stars since it is so simple plus delicious. I did make the allrecipes modifications for high altitude since I'm in Denver and it is perfect."
"3","4","made it just . Cake turns out soft . People in my house who tried it rate 8/10 . Reduced sugar to 350g instead of 400g ( i've doubled it) , it still taste fine . Made this in 4 colour . SO ITS A RAINBOW CUPCake (;"
"3","2","March 12, 2012: After reading the reviews, I took several tips from people to increase the density/moisture. My cake was awesome. I also used Ideal no calorie sweetener (xylitol)in place of sugar. If you want a healthier version, do this: 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup smartbalance omega 3 cooking oil. 3/4 cup milk. 2 tbsp half & half. 1 cup Ideal sweetener. 1 tbsp of raw sugar. I found that beating the mixture until it looks whipped and airy makes a better result. I'm eating this and can't believe that there's only a tsbp of sugar in the whole cake, and I was an avid sugar addict for years."
"3","5","this is the best recipe i've even made. As a stayhome dad, i'm always looking for easy recipes to do. The whole family loved it"
"3","5","Excellent recipe!! Perfect texture, not too dense not to fluffy. Like other reviewers said, cream butter and sugar very well and then beat in each egg very well and up milk to 3/4 cup. I also used cake flour vs AP. I found these make 13 cupcakes rather than 12. I also added a 1-2 tps or so of sprinkles and make them 'funfetti' style. The recipe is a total keeper, you'lll never by boxed again! :)"
"3","5","I had some strawberries to use up, and just wanted a simple cake recipe that I could whip up real quick. I only wanted to make enough strawberry shortcake for me and my husband, so I cut the recipe in half, and it still made six large cupcakes. I read some comments that said this is a dense cake, so after the batter was mixed, I whipped it on high for two minutes to make it lighter. This was my first time using silicone bake-wear, but it turned out perfect. This recipe is so easy, and so delicious. I can't wait to make it for company."
"3","5","This is awesome! Thank you so much for sharing. I tried it out on my own the first time, but its so easy I cant wait to get my little girl to help. We are always wanting something sweet but money keeps us from buying junk food. This in mini-cupcake form is perfect!!!"
"3","5","Loved it!! I added 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 and it was wonderful. Will add extra vanilla extract next time. The only problem I had was that it was not fully baked even after I reached 40min mark and got slightly dark on edges...as one reviewer suggested..if this happens again I will reduce the temp. to 250F till it is baked."
"3","5","This recipe is fantastic! The cake turned out moist and very delicious. I dirty iced this cake with butter cream icing (1 cup of icing sugar, 1 cup of room-temp. butter, 1 tablespoon of milk and half a teaspoon of banana extract) and then made marshmallow fondant to cover the cake. Since this was my first time working with fondant it was pretty sloppy, but when it comes down to it, wow did it ever taste good!!!"
"3","5","Absolutely WONDERFUL! Really is a simple white cake and I totally agree - tastes like a sugar cookie! Thanks so much for the tasty recipe - I don't like using mixes and this is probably easier!!"
"3","1","The cake was very bland in taste and didn't bake well at all. Maybe it's just me but I think cake needs a little bit of flavor too. Nice try though."
"3","5","This is the only white cake recipe I use. I make it because it's easy and very good. Light and fluffy too. Bake time in MY oven is only 18 minutes. The frosty I use is 'Creamy Frosting' by Carol from this site. NOTE: Any recipe I make calling for milk products, I substitute Lactose Free Whole Milk."
"3","5","It really does taste like bakery cake. I made cupcakes and used the butter cream frosting from AR for a friends birthday and got rave reivews for it ! Nice Job!!"
"3","4","this was pretty good, although i did make a few modifications...1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract, 3/4 c milk, ~1 tsp fine sea salt, and ~1 c semi-sweet choc chips. i got 14 cupcakes (using a standard sized ice cream scoop as the measuring cup). the texture was very light and fluffy and the flavor was pretty good but not 'pow' delicious. maybe next time i will add a little more extract or something. if you had issues with the consistency/texture, make sure all of your ingredients are at room temp before using (including milk and eggs), that helps everything blend smoothly so you won't run the risk of overmixing to ensure all ingredients are incorporated. it is a good base cupcake recipe, though. and so easy to make! thank you for sharing the recipe :-)"
"3","4","I'm with other reviewers and believe that you should add a 1/4-1/2 more milk. This cake tastes GREAT though, a true 'from scratch' cake, but it's not bland. Beat well and don't overbake! This cake is a great dense one that worked well with the fondant b-day cake I made."
"3","5","This recipe is amazing, especially if you add about 1/2 cup of sour cream to it :)"
"3","5","Excellent recipe! Very simple and I always have the ingredients on hand. I added 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves and gave it a bit of a fall flavor. Very good!"
"3","5","This white cake is so simple and yummy.... My family loves it! The first time I made it it tasted a little... like pancakes!!! So tonight I decided to make mini cupcakes (I doubled this recipe and got 100 mini cupcakes)... When making mini cupcakes bake for 10 minutes at 350... This time it tasted like sugar cookies... I only made a couple changes... I added 1 cup of vanilla pudding (which kinda took place of some of my vanilla)... And I only put in a tablespoon of vanilla (that was only because I only had a tablespoon left... I cant stop eating them... I think I like them better without frosting... I will make this recipe again... Thanks for Sharing!"
"3","5","We made this recipe two times in one week! And we absolutely loved it! We didn't have vanilla the first time,so we substituted coconut extract and they came out fantastic!!! This recipe will be used many,many times!!!"
"3","5","Probably one of the best cakes I've ever made. I made it exactly as per the recipe, except that I doubled the recipe for a large group. So moist and so delicious. Got raves. Several of our guests went back for seconds."
"3","3","Decent taste....not too sweet not too blah. I took others suggestions and did half shortening, half butter with extra milk. It is a very dense cornbread type consistency."
"3","3","not as moist as i would have liked"
"3","5","I would give even more stars if that was possible. such a quick and delicious batter to make. I filled the cupcakes with grape jelly and frosted them with a peanut butter frosting. to die for! first cupcakes to ever work out perfectly! :)"
"3","5","I have made this cake dozens of times in pans up to 14x14 and have never changed a think about the ingredients.......I have also never really been a stickler to exact times in beating and cooking and it has ALWAYS turned out PERFECT!?, if you are making two cakes in a row make sure your oven isn't too hot! Sometimes I turn mine off in-between layers to make sure it is not over heating.....which will make it cook inconsistently! Beware that your kitchen maybe warmer if you have already cooked one thus making your butter more liquid!"
"3","5","best simplest cake ever"
"3","5","love this cake!!!!"
"3","5","I use this recipe all the time^_^ Always turns out great, every time! yumm"
"3","5","I thought this cake was great. It was very dense, but I didn't think it was as dense as I thought it would be (according to other reviews). I made tye-dye miniature cupcakes using this batter. They were absolutely delicious and everyone has been gobbling them up! It definitely tasted like a sugar cookie and the taste was unique and, of course, yummy!  Tips to get the cupcakes a little fluffier: I read what some other users said and used their tips, which worked great. Don't add in the egg yolks, make sure to add in egg whites. Also, after adding in the flour/baking powder mixture and 1/2 cup of milk, the cake batter was still very dense and almost 'doughy' like. I added in approximately 3/4 cup all together and the batter got to a perfect consistency.  I will definitely make this again!   Btw: tasted great with a little bit of vanilla frosting on top :)"
"3","5","This recipe is so easy. I needed a double layer cake and looking at the ingredients I needed to double the recipe in order to get a double layer cake. I make the cake on the Wed. and decorated it on Friday evening for my gathering on Saturday. The cake stayed very moist - I was so pleased and got a lot of compliments on the moistness of the cake."
"3","5","I made this recipe with no changes except for adding lots of sliced fresh strawberries (that I had to use up in something) and this was TO DIE FOR!! I made a strawberry pink frosting to put on top. I think I've gone to heaven."
"3","5","this is sooooo awesome!!!! i made the recipe just as it said here the first time just to see how it would taste. then i added two tablespoons of extra flavoring (butter-rum). and WOW! it was awesome. definitely will keep this for my baking company i am trying to start... thank you soooooo much!!!"
"3","4","I gave this recipe only 4 stars because when I made it the way they have it here, it came out really dense. It wasn't inedible but everyone who tried it asked me if I knew why it was dense. I had an idea why. Almost every other white cake recipe I saw only uses egg whites, not whole eggs. So, this last time I made them with egg whites and it turned out great! Another reason some cakes turn out dense is if you over-mix the batter. Hope this helps :)"
"3","5","Really delicious! I made as-as with the exception of adding a little more milk. I used almond milk (vanilla unsweetened) and the cupcakes could not have been more perfect. Whole-hearted 5 stars from me!"
"3","5","Doubled this, otherwise following the recipe exactly, and it made exactly 24 cupcakes. I made them rainbow with food coloring and they looked and tasted DELICOUS. Add to recipe box ;)"
"3","5","Excellent springboard recipe! I used this cake as the base of a Key Lime cake with buttercream frosting also from this site and it was both easy and delicious."
"3","5","I used this recipe for cake pops and it turned out perfect! I think it's stiffness was a plus! I did tweak the recipe a little, but it's simplicity and delicious taste gave me faith in my homemade cake making abilities again!  Changes that I made: I doubled the recipe and added an extra 1/2 c milk (1/4 c for single recipe) I used a butter flavored Crisco stick and 2 Tbsp water in place of butter.  Turned out great!"
"3","4","The recipe is simple. The taste is exceptional. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was looking for a more rounded, smooth top to make cupcakes that look like balloons. The tops of these were, as other reviews remarked, gritty looking like cornbread. The tops also broke and cracked when being removed from the pan so I was not able to frost them smoothly. This was the BEST tasting of all my test batches and won hands down in my taste tests. It was just not functional enough for my purposes."
"3","5","This turned out fabulous, I made cupcakes and they were ready in 20 minutes. They were very light and fluffy even though I've heard some reviewers called them 'heavy' or 'dense'. The tops turned out a little crusty like a sugar cookie, was wonderful!"
"3","4","This cake was very mosit and tasted great! I used it for Tie Dye Cupcakes and they came out perfect!"
"3","4","4 stars for taste 2 stars for presentation :/ although it is very tasty it is also very sweet so I would recommend 1/2 cup of sugar instead because 1 hole cup of sugar left a sour after taste in my mouth due to the sugar over load :)"
"3","5","I took the suggestion of adding more milk and this cake was wonderful. It is a very sweet cake, but not overly sweet."
"3","5","This cake is perfect! I used buttermilk though. I will use this recipe again!"
"3","3","This was an okay recipe. I made it for a friend's birthday party-- did two layers and made a quick chocolate buttercream icing. People generally liked it. I got lots of a compliments and a few even came back for seconds.  I followed some of the tips as well as the regular recipe-- added some extra milk, looked for a consistency of yellow cool whip, even beat the heck out of my eggs. I don't think this was really like white cake-- maybe that explains the comparison to a sugar cookie. It has a nice sort of light flavor, but it was too dense for my tastes. I appreciated that it wasn't too sweet though. It matched well with the icing-- my friend's choice combo.  I made the 'Joy of Cooking's' White cake batter recipe 2 a couple of days later since both my boy and my bestie love white cake. It took maybe an extra few minutes and was so light and airy, I couldn't believe it.  White cake probably shouldn't have yolks. Take the extra few minutes to beat up your egg whites properly. Totally worth it!"
"3","3","While this is a good cake, it isn't really white it is yellow. It does taste like a sugar cookie which makes sense considering that if you delete the milk and add some baking soda you have sugar cookies. Cake turns out crumbly and if you are icing it you will definitely need to do a crumb coat."
"3","5","I made this cake yesterday, it turned out a bit watery but a little flour did the trick! It turned out amazing, they were by the night, I would recommend this recipe for people who might be in a hurry and need to make a quick deilicious dessert."
"3","3","I thought it tasted fine but I am not a big cake person. Reviews from both kids and a few adults were that it was 'okay'."
"3","5","If you are looking for a delicious white cake look no further. I am a novice cake baker and I can't say enough positives about this recipe. Easy to follow, bake, and eat! The only change I made was to use an eighth of a teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I think that it created some depth to the cake flavor. Frosted with a vanilla buttercream and topped with multi-colored jimmies (sprinkles). Oh, I made these as cupcakes, took about sixteen minutes at three fifty."
"3","5","Made this recipe twice now. The second time I used 3/4 cup milk and the cake came out perfectly fluffy and moist. Also added an extra splash of vanilla. Will use this again and again, especially for cupcakes!"
"3","5","WOW!!! this is a goooood cake, although it makes a small amount, and not really good for cupcakes (mine had a sinkhole :-( ) I also have to agree with one other that doubling this recipe is not the best choice. I tried it and my cake had a huge undone sinkhole in the middle. I re-made the same batch and it came out great. The modifications I done was increased and subed the milk (buttermilk...didn't have reg. milk) to 3/4 cup as others suggested and increased the vanilla to 1 Tb and added 1 t of almond (yum-o). I also added about 1/4 t of salt to take some of the bland taste away. A little stuck to the bottom of the pan, other than that it came out a lot better. I will use parchment in the bottom of my pan to ensure no sticking occurs next time I have to bake this again."
"3","2","followed exact recipe and it tasted like cornbread."
"3","5","This cupcake is exactly what it promised to be. Simply, great tasting and easy. I made cupcakes and then used them to make strawberry shortcake. They were a hit with my family. This recipe is definitely a keeper!"
"3","5","This was great!! I cut the sugar by about 1/4 C., and increased the milk to 1 C. the cake was really tasty. I stopped in the middle of making this to get a phone call and about 45 minutes later I got back to it and get it in the oven. This was not a dry cake, I served it with berries as short cake style as well as frosting the other half for a serving tomorrow."
"3","5","I love this recipe, it's an amazing base for any white cake. For those who think it's not 'moist' enough, besides making sure you REALLY beat the eggs, add 1 snack pack of vanilla pudding to the mixture at the end (pudding snacks in baking isle NOT jello pudding snacks in the diary isle) For cupcakes, I like adding a half a cup of sprinkles to make it funfetti like!"
"3","5","very yummy. I backed off by half a cup on the sugar the second time I made them. Just preference is all. The recipe is fantastic."
"3","5","Great flavor with this simple recipe! Thank you for sharing."
"3","4","This was easy to make and was pretty tasty. From other reviews, I expected a dense cake (I made cupcakes) but it was even heavier than I expected. I suspect it was partly due to overmixing of the batter (I tried to dye it purple for Easter, didn't work very well since the batter was yellow-ish, and led to mixing too much, trying to blend the colour in) and also overbaking. The time stated here would have been too much in my oven, I did 18 minutes and probably could have done a minute or two less. Still it was an easy and good cake to make, I would make again, being careful about overmixing."
"3","5","Amazing! Followed other readers' reviews and added more milk (3/4 cup milk...I used 1/2 vanilla milk & 1/2 plain milk). And I replaced regular flour with unbleached cake flour (still sifted it). Creamed butter & eggs very well. These were moist & yummy. Why better then boxed and just as easy."
"3","4","agree with other reviewers. I used my kitchen aide to mix and let it mix for a while. Also added more milk and vanilla. Can't wait to experiment more with this one!"
"3","5","This recipe is extremely easy and tastes great, I don't think I had any problems. It's really good for beginners like myself and would be a great recipe to use when baking with kids."
"3","4","good to have a 'basic' recipe. I only had vanilla imitation extract which I hate. I guess if I had used the vanilla bean extract it would have made it more lovely. Plus, it is sooo sweet (even for me that has a really sweet tooth), I might replace white sugar with a darker variety and a little less of it."
"3","5","This was really easy to make and turned out well. I made one batch with baking margarine and one with butter and I actually liked the margarine one better. Both batches puffed up nicely but fell as they cooled. Anyone know why?"
"3","4","excellent, it's exactly what it says. Simple white cake recipe!!!"
"3","5","I was worried about this because I made this into cupcakes and while they were in the oven I read the reviews. Despite some of the issues others had, I made them exactly as written and they are delicious!! I won't change anything and will for sure make these again!"
"3","5","This recipe is oh so very flexible. I know it's not a good idea to go too far, but I decided to make a half and half cake for my daughter's class. Half was white/vanilla and the other was chocolate. It was surprisingly good. Substitute the vanilla with cocoa and it's quite shocking. I've played around with it since, adding marshmallows and chocolate chips and it comes out great everytime... that I beat it long enough. This cake does require a good mixing time, but it is completely worth it."
"3","4","whipped eggs and sugar for 10 mins and whipped everything else for a long time- used 3/4 C milk"
"3","3","Made this exact recipe, with the exception of a little extra milk (not sure how much, didn't measure). It had good flavor, but was definitely not light and fluffy. It had the same exact consistency of a pancake! I thought it was okay, but my boyfriend loved the pancake-like texture. I will probably look for a different white cake recipe next time."
"3","5","This has become my go-to recipe for birthday cakes. It turns out perfect every time. It's especially good with white chocolate ganache!"
"3","4","I couldn't decide if I should give this 3 or 4 stars. I made the recipe into cupcakes, for my son's 17th birthday. I filled them with raspberry all-fruit jam, and topped them with lemon icing. My son really liked them, but I agree with other reviewers that the texture was slightly 'gritty', like cornmeal, even though I made sure to beat all ingredients well, until very light and fluffy. I used free range eggs, purchased from a local farm, and the batter was VERY yellowish!"
"3","5","Easy and delicious! I made a few changes:  * 1/4 cup less sugar; the reason I made this is because I'm sick of saccharine cake mixes! It may not be sweet enough for you, but for me, it's fine.   * 1/4 cup more milk, as per other reviews... I'd hate to see what this would be like without it!  * half butter and half shortening, because I ran out of butter… sad, sad day in my household   * I beat the bejesus out of the butter/sugar mix and after every egg"
"3","4","The only modification I made was to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I made 12 cupcakes and 20 mini cupcakes from this recipe, filling each cup a little over half full). The mini's baked for 15 mins at 350 and the regular sized ones baked for 20 mins at 350. I understand the cornbread comments, as the TEXTURE of the outside is similar. However, the inside is moist and yummy! This was a little sweeter than the white cake recipes I'm used to and with icing (I piped on Buttercream Icing from this site) it was almost too sweet! These taste great as sweet-muffins (without icing) and I would advise to limit the frosting if you plan to frost!"
"3","3","The only thing I did differently was use margarine instead of butter. I tried that horrible Magnolia Cupcake recipe from another site, so anything after that would've been good. These were easy enough to make, but they weren't great like every other reviewer went on about. All I did was cream the margarine and sugar together, mix in the eggs 1 by 1 with the mixer, added the rest of the wet ingredients, and then beat the dry ingredients in by hand. They still came a bit dry. I guess I should've added a bit more milk like the other reviewers said *shrugs*."
"3","2","White Cake???? How can a recipe that calls for two whole eggs be a white cake? Impossible. My daughter made these today and they had the consistency of cornbread. I figure she did something wrong, but then again these are called white cake, so maybe the recipe is wrong..."
"3","5","add lavender for a yummy and classy twist"
"3","5","Delicious. Maybe my portions were off but I did end up adding a few extra tbs of flour at the end of mixing it all up because it looked a bit too buttery/greasy to me but I'm sure it would of been just fine. Turned out super light, fluffy and perfectly moist. Thanks so much for this easy recipee!"
"3","5","I took the other reviewers suggestions and it turned out great! I creamed the butter and sugar for 10 minutes in my stand mixer, added an additional 1/4 cup of milk, added an additional 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and sifted the flour and baking powder. I will definitely make this again!"
"3","1","I did not care for this cake. It is as dry as Grandma used to make."
"3","4","This is a great recipe. I am young, and new to baking, and I got a lot of compliments with this cake. I read the reviews before hand, and a lot of others recommended adding a bit more milk. I added about a quarter cup extra milk, and the cake was light, fluffy and moist. Considering I don't know much about baking, it was pretty simple. Definitely a repeat!"
"3","5","this cake was sooo good! i used it for small cupcakes and lowered the time to 15 minutes instead of 20 and it worked great :)"
"3","5","Love this cake. I probably have made it at least 5 times in the past couple of weeks. All for cupcakes and once for the mini Boston cream pies. Perfect everytime. The only change is I use buttermilk."
"3","4","I made some minor changes to this recipe that resulted in a very good cake (or cupcake in my case.) First, you simply cannot have a whole cup of sugar in anything without at least 1 tsp of salt. This is baking 101. And secondly, once I creamed the butter and sugar together I beat the heck out of it while adding the eggs. And once they were added I beat the heck out of it some more, until it was thick and fluffy. I also used a combination of vanilla and almond extracts, but that's just my preference. Next time I will double the recipe though because this resulted in only 17 regular sized cupcakes. I also baked for a few less minutes than called for. Thanks for a good, basic cake recipe."
"3","4","This cake was really good, but I tweaked it. Like another reviewer, I added 3 tablespoons more milk and used a full tablespoon (approximately one more teaspoon) on vanilla extract. The cup cakes came out moist, delicious, and spongy."
"3","2","This ended up tasting almost exactly like my favorite cornbread recipe...not exactly what I was going for when I set out to make cupcakes. The cupcakes were dense and moist but not very sweet and tasted too eggy for me."
"3","5","Easy Recipe. I made no adjustments to the recipe. Make sure you cream the sugar well and incorporate the eggs thoroughly. This cake rises well and was surprisingly light."
"3","4","I doubled this recipe (plus an extra 1/3 cup of milk) to make a two-layer cake for Christmas. I made a couple of tester cupcakes, as well, and I was very impressed! It was moist and delicious. The only reason I deducted a star was because the cake shrinks significantly upon cooling, though it looks like it's about to overflow in the pan while baking in the oven. Don't let that fool you, though. It doesn't effect the delicious taste. It'll just make for a smaller cake."
"3","5","I make this all the time and my kids love adding to the basic recipe to create new cupcakes. Today we mixed two tubes of mini M&M's to the batter and added a full teaspoon of dulce de leche to each cupcake center before putting it into the oven. This was the best version yet. Beautiful and with the caramel filling... it was to die for! :) obs- I spray a plate with PAM and drop little teaspoons of dulce de leche into it before popping it in the freezer for half an hour. This makes it easier to just throw into the batter once you fill the cupcake pan. It also won't melt so you don't end up with a pool of dulce de leche in the bottom as opposed to in the center."
"3","5","Moist and delicious !!!! This is a wonderful recipe. I did as others added 3/4 cup milk plus I added 1 cup of coconut. The batter looked a bit odd but I popped it in the muffin tins and hoped for the best. They came out perfect and moist. Don't over cook these folks. The frosting I put on these was 1/2 the recipe from German Sweet Chocolate Cake 1. Be sure to cook the frosting until it is good and thick so it doesn't slide off the muffins. I was looking for a decent white muffin recipe and this is it....look no further folks...YUM. Thanks to Scottosman for sharing."
"3","5","Delicious and easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out light and fluffy. I beat the sugar, butter and eggs until it was very fluffy, and when I mixed in the flour, I did that by hand. Everyone who tasted it loved it."
"3","4","This cake is delicious, but if you are looking for less of a cornbread like consinstancy, use egg whites only and up it one egg. This will not only make the cake fluffier and less dense, but a true white cake."
"3","5","Great cake! I baked this in a round 9 inch pan and it turned out wonderfully. It did have a texture reminiscent of corn bread but the extra teaspoon of vanilla I used gave it a stronger vanilla cake flavor. I frosted the cake with the wedding cake frosting from this site and it was fabulous."
"3","4","Very good cake, and somewhat similar to a 'sugar cookie' flavor. I used half shortening, half butter for a more moist cake, as cakes made with all butter sometimes have a tendency to turn out a little dry. I doubled the recipe to fill my Wilton Jack O' Lantern pan and it was perfect. I baked for about 50 minutes at 350 degrees. I didn't think this cake was really sweet at all, I wish it was a bit sweeter, but frosting this with a buttercream icing took care of that. I will use this again for an easy cake that uses ingredients I always have on hand. Thanks for sharing :)"
"3","5","Those who described this as a sugar cookie-like cupcake are right on. If you add a bit more milk as some recommend, the top doesn't get puffy like some cuppies, but spills onto the tin and gets crispy. Delish! Am making these for my daughter's birthday and am frosting them with buttercream frosting, but are perfectly servable plain."
"3","4","I did this recipe exactly as written. VERY good flavor! I made this into cupcakes. I did not give 5 stars for two reasons. Hardly makes enough for 24 cupcakes and it had a yellow hue to it. Not that that's bad, but I was really looking for a white cupcake. I will make again every time I need yellow cake though. Much better than box mixes. Thanks for the recipe SCOTTOSMAN!!!! Late Edit**** Once these cooled and were ready to frost, they did kinda have the texture of cornbread like another reviewer noticed. Still good flavor, but not fluffy and moist once they cooled."
"3","5","Being a youg cook i love simple and tasty. and this!? this is perfect! I love it! 5 stars. ;D"
"3","4","This was the first cake I've ever baked from scratch. The recipe is so simple, it was great for a beginning baker. It was more sweet & dense than I prefer, but it's a great starter for experimenting. For example, while in the middle of mixing, I realized that I was out of vanilla extract. I used Grand Marnier instead, and the flavor was fantastic. I may never use store-bought mix again. My husband has a serious sweet-tooth, and he loved it."
"3","1","I used others suggestions and increased the milk to 3/4 of a cup. Sadly it still came out incredibly dry. It also lacked in flavor. I ended up tossing the whole thing out. I'll be looking for another cake recipe to use in the future."
"3","5","Delicious! doubled the recipe - i made cupcakes for a wedding shower and everyone loved them. This is a great recipe. Its so simple and yummy. Thanks Scottosman"
"3","5","I made cupcakes. Did add a little extra skim milk and used bread flour (all I had). They came out light and fluffy. Really good!"
"3","3","I appear to be in the minority but the addition of vanilla and salt makes a big difference, and if you want a lighter cake please subsitute cake flour and also add a little more milk. Full fat milk is better and definitely butter."
"3","4","Well, clearly the recipe has a slight issue because it lacks enough moisture. I added the recommended amount of milk (extra 1/4c), filled the cupcake liners to about 3/4 full using my cookie scoop, and added 1/2t of almond extract which really rounded out the flavor. I don't know how so many people can compare this to cornbread, unless you use boxed cornbread which is mostly flour and sugar anyway. This isn't a box mix, with lots of extra chemicals in it to make it super fluffy, so you shouldn't expect that. read this if you're not familiar with 'creaming' since it's pretty important in cakes to avoid a grainy texture. I also thought it wasn't overly sweet, which was good, since that's what frosting is for!"
"3","5","This is delicious. I only had cake flour on hand, so I subbed that in, and it made the lightest, fluffiest cupcakes I've ever baked. I didn't find the need to beat the egg mixture to death, though, in order to achieve the perfect texture. I just followed directions and ended up with perfection. I did add 1/8 cup more milk as others suggested. I'm really pleased with this recipe and plan to pass it along to my friends."
"3","5","I absolutely love this recipe. I dont even but the box cake mix anymore. I have made a formal bridal shower cake out of it and also a fun cake for a bachelorette party. It stays very moist wrapped in foil in the fridge for quite a few days. So glad I found this recipe!!"
"3","5","This is a dense cake that makes an AMAZING strawberry shortcake base! My husband adored it, shortcake is his favorite dessert so he is very picky about it!"
"3","5","Wow! possibly the best white cake recipe I've ever used! It was so soft and moist. I'm definitely using this for my next party."
"3","5","I made this for a fondant class I was taking. I let my family eat it after I had finished my 'creation.' They absolutely LOVED this cake. I was glad that they told me it was better than any boxed cake I've ever made! I'll be using this for birthday cakes from now on. I did add 1/4 of milk, as suggested. What a light and flavorful cake!!"
"3","5","These just came out of my oven - I'm surprised how much they smell and taste like sugar cookies! I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have milk, so I added 1/2 cup liquid whipping cream and 1/4 cup water. These are soft, fluffy, moist and ooooooh so good. I haven't made the icing yet...and I'm not sure I will. The flavour of these is amazing. Be sure to whip the butter and sugar for a good long time to attain the fluffiness of a good cupcake. I'm going to stop typing and go eat another..."
"3","4","I made this after I messed up a box cake- yes, I did that- and this tastes just like the sheet cakes you can get from the grocery store bakery. It held up to buttercream frosting pretty well too. I made it for a Wilton course, this was really easy to make. It's very sweet though."
"3","5","I tried this recipe a month ago and it came out great. THen I made it for the second time but I used whole wheat flour and almond milk instead and it came out very moist and fluffy. Yum :)"
"3","5","Easy and very good flavor. Next time I will put just 3/4 cups of sugar just because it's to sweet for my taste."
"3","4","simple and tasty. i liked it, very dense and moist, boyfriend thought it was a bit 'eggy'. will try again with a few tweaks!"
"3","4","This recipe isn't as fluid as I would have expected, I added 2 egg whites, and it came out perfectly. Great for our birthday bash!"
"3","4","I did what another reviewer recommended and mixed the eggs in for a LONG time. My batter was very fluffy. I also added a little extra milk and vanilla. It was yummy!"
"3","5","This is the best white cake ever. I used to make the heavenly white cake (from this web site), which was good, but it had to many ingredients. I thought that this cake would be dry, but it was not, it was better than all the other cakes. Yummy..."
"3","5","This was a wonderful cake recipe, tastes fantastic and was super easy to make! I tend to cook desserts on a spur of the moment basis. I did not have a homemade cake recipe and I found this one and tried it because I had all the ingredients readily available. I also made cupcakes with it. For me and the way I fill my cupcake liners it made 14 cupcakes. (Which is all the liners I had anyway!) My mix was not dry and did not have any problems at all. I actually forgot the suggestion to beat the eggs for 9min or whatever but I did mix each one well and it still came out great! I did make sure the butter and sugar mixture was WELL mixed and fluffy though. I used a fork to initially mix it and then used the mixer to finish it and fluff it. I also added the extra milk so I used 3/4 cup of milk. This mix is thicker than a box of cake mix, but it is fluffy at the same time. I will definitely be using this recipe again! I plan to double it when I want to make it for a bunch of people. If you are making something for just two or four people to eat this is the perfect amount as-is."
"3","4","I just made this cake as part of a three tier wedding cake. I calculated the recipe for 30 servings and had enough to make two extremely tall 6' and 8' round layers. The texture is wonderful, very dense and soft, just like a wedding cake should be. I did cut down half a cup on the sugar, and added half a teaspoon of salt to the recipe. It has a nice taste to it as well. I will definitely keep this recipe for the future!"
"3","5","I have made this recipe several times. I made cupcakes and I doubled the recipe to do a 9x13 birthday cake. I ended up cutting the birthday cake in half and putting a custard filling in between the layers. It was a hit. Every time I make this recipe, it gets rave reviews. As a few other people have mentioned, I needed to add more milk to the recipe, but overall a hit!"
"3","3","This was good but nothing special about it so I just gave it 3 stars for average. I kind of like the boxed kind better. It was easy though I give it that. However, I did accidentally put in one cup of butter instead of half...so that could have affected the outcome."
"3","5","This cake is AMAZING... It melts in your mouth. I did the recipe as stated except I accidentally added 1 c. of butter instead of 1/2 c. I like buttermilk in my white cake recipes so I used 3/4 c. buttermilk instead of just plain milk. Then I added sprinkles to my batter to make it appear more like the 'funfetti' cakes you see in the store. I made cupcakes out of this recipe and the consistency of the batter before I placed it in the muffin tins was like fluffy whipped cream. Soooo delicious. Will definitely use again!"
"3","4","Yum!! I took others suggestions and added the extra 1/4 cup milk. I actually doubled the recipe and used 1 cup plain flour and 2 cups wholewheat plain flour. Turned out great! Now I've just got to cut it out and frost it into a truck!"
"3","5","its so funny that since i lost my job at one of my country's top bakeries, i was constantly seeking to make a cake recipe just like theirs. i wasted so many ingredients including my mothers gas over the past year trying to find a recipe even close to theirs. i am still in shock that i actually found it and it tastes exactly like theirs, if not, even better!!! i actually jumped up and down at the first bite. im not exaggerating, if you have tried this recipe you wld understand. oh!, and just 1 tip guys, i did this recipe with water instead of milk. ok, now im off to put a certain bakery out of business!! and thank you!!!!"
"3","4","This cake could really be improved upon with a few simple changes. Substitute whole milk, add 1 teaspoon of almond extract, use cake flour instead of all purpose and change the butter to unsalted butter then put in a pinch of salt."
"3","5","I wanted to make a cake for my husband's birthday. This appeared to have good reviews and seemed pretty simple to make. First, let me say that I specifically signed up for membership so that I could write a review for this recipe -I've used this site many times before and have never done so. Light,tasty...scrumptious. My husband loved it too. I've been looking for a 'from scratch' recipe that I could use and add to my repertoire - this is the one. Thanks."
"3","5","It was an amazingly moist cake. i added a cup of wallnuts and cranberries before baking. it gave a soft yet crunchy taist, with a sweet after taist!another good addition is 2 top it off with fresh strawberries be4 serving!!"
"3","1","I followed this recipe to the tiniest details and was extremely disappointed with the results. The result tasted like dry, mealy, old cornbread. Imagine how embarrassed I was to serve this at my grandmother's 81st birthday party!"
"3","5","This is the most simple and delicious white cake recipe I've ever made. I really enjoy making home made cakes. This goes on the top of my list of favorite ones. It is moist, dense, fluffy, and flavorful.  I've made white cakes that require complicated steps such as beating the egg whites, and folding them into the batter, etc. I'd put this right alongside of the most complicated recipe, and I believe it would still come out on top.  I bookmarked this recipe, but didn't put it in my recipe folder. I panicked because I couldn't find it. I found another white cake recipe on here and made it. It was a disappointment compared to this one. This is just the best! I have searched for several years for a basic white cake recipe that is easy, quick, and scrumptious.  This one is a keeper!"
"3","3","I would give it 3 1/2 if I could... I thought they were very grainy. My husband and the kids liked them, but they'll eat anything sweet."
"3","4","Very nice. I made it for a very picky eater who really ended up liking it. It is simple, though, so I would reccomend a STRONG frosting."
"3","5","EASY, TASTY, QUICK! Only thing I changed was the all purpose flour to cake flour. I bet it's even good with the all purpose flour too, lol but I'm a cake purist... Chef Marian Thompson"
"3","5","absolutely amazing!! I have made this recipe 4 times in 3 days and it comes out perfectly every single time, even if you're not exact on the ingredients. :)  It's so dense and rich, yet light and fluffy at the same time. I don't know how to explain it, but it is SO good!  We've been using it for strawberry shortcake. Absolutely amazing. :)"
"3","4","I give 4.5 stars. It tasted like regular white cakes. Nothing special. I made this for my mother's birthday; had the cake with whipped cream and strawberry sauce. My family liked the cake a lot though I still thought it was plain. I shifted the flour mixture and took a longer time for beating the butter mixture. (Beat until it became like yellow whipped cream.) This makes the cake moist and fluffy."
"3","5","This is a perfect recipe if your looking to make a small cake. I was looking for an alternative to a box mix since my family is small and the left over cake seems to go to waste. I made an 8-inch single layer cake for dessert tonight and the family loved it. It has a nice texture, a little on the dense side when compared to a box mix. I didn't have any butter on hand and had to use margarine, which is probably why the flavor seemed a little off to me, but I will definately make this one again."
"3","5","This was the first time I made cupcakes from scratch. I sifted the flour.I added the vanilla to the milk.I used expensive european style challenge unsalted butter. I was told by a professional pastry chef to always use the best ingredients. It does makes a huge difference in the taste of the final product. I let the egg and milk get to room temperature since I was told to do this as well. These cupcakes were delicious. They had a rich taste. My 14 and 16 year old nephews perfer my old Duncan Hines yellow cupcakes made with apple sauce. I like those as well and you are able to eat more than one in a sitting. These cupcakes were rich tasting and one was enough. I would make them again. The consistency was perfect, not sure why others said they had a weird consistency. I liked the fact that there was no salt added. This recipe was also in the Joy of Cooking cookbook.Revised 7/7/09. Original review was 3/2/08. I completely forgot I made this recipe last year. It's amazing when using different butter how different your cake tastes. This didn't taste as rich as last years version. I could have eaten half this cake. I used a pyrex 7 ¼” x 11.5”(83 sq inches) glass pan. I don’t own a 9”x9” (81 sq inch) pan. (83 sq inches vs. 81 sq. inches, it worked). It was a rectangle shape, which I was looking for, because I made the US Flag pictured earlier in the week for July 4th."
"3","4","This is a very nice basic white cake (I made them as cupcakes, a double recipe makes almost 3 dozen!) I added an extra 1/2 C milk for the double recipe. As for the 'cornbread taste' other reviewers complained of, I think this happens if you don't mix the milk well enough into the flour/butter mixture at the end. I mixed until the batter was totally smooth. Also, don't overbake. They will come out moist and wonderful! What a great alternative to boxed cake mix."
"3","5","don't want 'cornbread' texture? I added the milk before the flour mixture, and HAVE TO stir until the sugar disolves. I stirred until the whole batter was very silky smooth. I also substituted the milk for 3/4 cup heavy cream & added a pinch of salt...extremely good taste. My husband doesn't like cake normally, but went for seconds. Won't do boxed again."
"3","3","To me readers either like this cake or they wish to keep searching for something better. Put me in the latter category. On the positive side, it was easy to make, and tasted good. I will make it again UNTIL I find my something better, but know I am searching. Why? It was a bit dry and crumbly as some of the readers stated. If you were to compare it to a wedding cake, which I have eaten many of, working in the wedding industry, it did not have nearly the water inside it that I expected, nor did it stay together the manner in which a cake should stay together when cutting it with a fork. It did taste good, though, and was a pleaser, just that I know there are many others that could please better out there. I'm still searching for that something better."
"3","2","The cake has amazing flavour but it clearly states that one recipe bakes either 12 cupcakes or 1 9x9... when in fact it bake 2!!! It is the first time in 25 years I ruin a cake. It rose very high, too quicly and half of it fell at the bottom of my oven. This correction should be made: the cake makes 2 - 9x9"
"3","3","This came out very dense and flat, even after trying it twice (I made a second layer since the 9X13 was so flat). In my second attempt I made sure the eggs and butter were room temperature, but even with many minutes of whipping in my mixer with the beater, it never did fluff up. I was looking for something lighter for the 4th Flag Cake I made, but at least the flavor was still good."
"3","5","Best cake recipe I've found yet! It was moist and fluffy. Others I've tried have always been very heavy. I just used 1 tablespoon of baking powder instead of specified amount. It was very good. Highly recommend this recipe!"
"3","5","It's sooo good!!! I made cupcakes with this recipe. kind a like muffins. but not so heavy. I did add little more milk, then stir in 3/4cups chocolate chips. came out perfect! Did not need frosting. My whole family loved it!"
"3","5","Recipe was simple and delicious! Not too sweet which I like. AWESOME!"
"3","5","Excellent and Easy! Nice, moist, (light yellow) cake. Added additional milk - about 1/8 cup. Definitely a great basic cake to keep on hand for birthdays, etc. Much better than using a mix."
"3","4","Made this for my husband, who is a big fan of white cake and always buys it by the piece from the grocery store. It was easy to make (nothing special) and satisfied his white cake craving. Good, sweet, easy."
"3","5","I used this recipe for the first time the other day to make cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly only doubling the ingredients to yield more. Quite possibly the best cake I've ever made! Thanks for the great recipe."
"3","4","I doubled this recipe to make a layer cake and followed another reviewer's suggestion to add 1-1/2 cups of milk instead of just one. The result was tasty and moist. As other reviewers have noted, it is a dense cake, which I think is typical of white cakes from scratch, but I am going to keep looking for a recipe that's a little bit lighter and fluffier."
"3","5","I'm a home ec teacher, so I've made a lot of cakes! And this one was absolutely excellent. It did require a slight adjustment, though. I doubled the recipe to make a layer cake and instead of just doubling the milk (to make 1 cup), I actually added 1 3/4 cups of milk. The other thing is that when you bake a cake, you have to make sure not to overbake it, or it will turn out mealy, as some have said. I baked it for 35 minutes - until it was just barely done. And it got rave reviews from everyone who tried it!"
"3","5","this was a really great cake to make especially if you're in a hurry!Its also really moist and fluffy and delicious,thank you for sharing the recipe!!"
"3","1","I hate to be negative, but this cake did not turn out at all! I doubled the recipe being sure that I didn't leave anything out. The batter was pastey and thick, which worried me, since the cake was for a birthday party. Regretably, I didn't have a back up plan. The cake was a flop. I even added the extra milk that some of the reviewers suggested. My advice...try this recipe out for yourself before planning to serve it to company! Sorry Scott :("
"3","5","very simple, fast and yummy. better than store bought mixes, and at least you know what is in it, and know what you are eating."
"3","4","I made this cake last night to use with some fresh strawberries. I doubled it and used a bundt pan; it was fabulous! The sugar in the recipe made the crust golden and 'crunchy'. Everyone loved it, a hit!!"
"3","2","This is really cornbread! Add a little butter and serve it with a pot roast! It doesn't taste bad, however, it's not what you will want if you are craving a moist white cake."
"3","5","I loved this cake. It was easy and quick and just right for my husband and myself. When I bake a larger cake, we both end up eating too much of it! It had that wonderful 'butter & egg' taste that only a 'homemade' cake has. I will definitely make this again."
"3","5","Wonderful and easy cake/cupcake recipe!!"
"3","5","I made this with cupcakes, it is a really good recipe. I put 3 tbs. of sprinkles in the batter so the cupcakes would come out speckled. it worked well! i used another recipe i found on this site for frosting: i used buttercream frosting 2, i think thats what its called. it worked well!"
"3","5","Everyone at the office and at home loved this cake (I used the cupcake version)."
"3","3","This cake was very simple! actually i made the cupcaked. The batter was thicker then a boxed cake mix and rich tasting. They baked up very nice. The color was more of a yellow cake..like a corn bread. Not light and fluffy....very heavy and the longer they sit...the drier they became(and i dont mean longer then 2 days)I liked hem best fresh from the oven with no frosting. I probably wont make them again...but continue searching for a nice white fluffy recipe."
"3","3","This was an easy recipe just not all that flavorfull"
"3","4","My sister made this for my mother's birthday celebration and the taste was very good. It was a little dry but that can easily be fixed with a great filling and frosting. It's a wonderful cake, taste really homemade and according to my sister quite easy to make."
"2","5","To the person who dissed this recipe based on the fact that they didn't read the ingredients list correctly, (claiming no vanilla extract or salt) ~ please, comprehend what you read before going off & insisting that you can do better .. It does in fact state vanilla extract as an ingredient, & the butter is not specified to be unsalted .. There's your salt madam. And don't forget the vanilla extract, its the fourth item on the ingredients list. Its a great recipe as is."
"2","5","Made this cake for my daughters birth day party! I added some lemon zest and two drops of lemon essential oil. I aslo add it a the salt and the extra milk one of the reviewers suggested.  I loved how it turned out!"
"2","5","best recipe ever! I used this recipe for cupcakes and they were perfect! I baked them for 10 mins then flipped the tray so the heat is equal and baked for another 10 mins, they turned out perfectly moist. one suggestion is that if you are out of eggs you can use mayonnaise! I know its a seems a bit weird but it works! I didn't have any eggs so I used 3 tbsp. for every 1 egg. it worked perfectly! overall great recipe."
"2","3","Was ok but came out very dense."
"2","5","Great recipe! Simple and delicious! I made cupcakes from this, and they didn't last long. Easy, straightforward, tasty!"
"2","5","Amazing! I used butter flavor shortening instead of butter and they came out as light as a feather! extreme fluffiness! my fave!"
"2","5","This has become my go to recipe for white cake. OK,so maybe its not a TRUE white cake because the yolks are added but it is close enough. It comes together easy and comes out delicious. Everyone I make it for loves it! It does have a tendency to be on the heavy side. I have been asked it it is pound cake. I think I will try adding a little more milk as it seems to have worked for other reviewers."
"2","3","Maybe I did something horribly wrong, but the cake had the consistency/texture of cornbread, and it didn't rise properly. I had to scramble for a different recipe :("
"2","5","Very moist and delicious. I doubled the recipe, layered the cake and then made choclate icing to frost. Loved it."
"2","4","Just made this and figured out how many calories it is so I made these in cupcake papers I put two tbsp of the batter in each one so one cupcake is 175 calories half a cupcake is 87.5 calories and half of 1 half is 43.75 calories haven't tried the cupcakes yet hopefully they taste all right I mean I tasted the batter it tasted good also I replaced he butter with margarine because of less calories!"
"2","5","Made this several times... But I recently moved and lost my cookbook, I couldn't find a good chocolate chip muffin recipe so... I threw mini chocolate chips in. They were wonderful. Such a good recipe. I did use cake flour. But other then that never changed recipe. Except for chocolate chips."
"2","5","My new 'old stand by' cake recipe. Love that it only makes 9x9 ."
"2","1","Sorry, but is the most driest, and flavorless recipe I've tried so far."
"2","5","This recipe was awesome!!! I added more milk and sprinkled in a little vanilla instant pudding. My daycare made it and they loved it. Thanks for the easy recipe. I will make it again."
"2","5","Perfect white cake recipe! I needed a simple cake to go with the fresh strawberries I had. This recipe turned out perfect, however, I did not have milk on hand so I used one cup of sour cream instead of milk. EXCELLENT! Very light and fluffy, not too sweet, perfect for the berry topping (fresh berries mixed with a little powdered sugar) after frosting this single layer 9-inch cake with some cream-cheese frosting. Add whipped cream on top for the perfect finish. This will be my new birthday cake recipe. Love It."
"2","5","Used 3/4c milk,1 tbs vanilla, and mixed every step well as suggested.. Awesome cupcakes!"
"2","4","This was a pretty respectable recipe. The crumb of the cake was a bit dense with the amount of milk asked for in the recipe, I might have added more.    I also forwent the vanilla, and added almond extract instead. I also folded in some raspberry preserves and topped with some chopped walnuts. It turned out quite well.    Those that are getting flatter cakes are either not creaming sufficiently after adding the eggs, or over mixing after adding the AP flour, forcing excessive gluten formation. Certain kinds of baking powder (single-action) can't sit around once mix into a moist environment. This means you can't allow the batter to sit around. If you're still having problems, try using a double-action baking powder.   I will try this recipe again. The first time through, the cake seems too flimsy to be used easily in layered cake. Perhaps some modification would be necessary."
"2","5","WOW! I can't believe how good this is! I'm SO against partially hydrogenated oils that the store brands put in their mixes so decided to give this a try and was very pleased. I doubled the recipe for a 13x11 cake and it baked up nicely! Based on other reviews, I made sure to take my time mixing all the ingredients well. I made a green poke cake for St. Patty's day using the Poor Man's Frosting from this site ('cuz store brands have transfats/HFC) and it turned out very good!! See my picture."
"2","3","It's white cake and that's about it. Kinda bland, kinda dry. Wish I'd put the ingredients towards making my pound cake."
"2","5","My first attempt at baking a cake from scratch was a success! I doubled the recipe and added a tad bit extra vanilla extract. My wife also suggested adding some almond extract, the aroma was to die for. Everyone loved it!"
"2","4","So I've been searching for a white/vanilla cake recipe and I think this will be a keeper. I have to say that I noted great tips from a few reviews. In order to provide a fair review though, I first tried the recipe as written. MY results: a really moist/fluffy cupcake. I beat butter/sugar as suggested until fluffy and then beat well after each addition of each of the remaining ingredients. The batter was fluffy, 'hard' - almost looked like softened ice cream. I was able to fill liners with a perfect scoop of batter (I used an ice cream scoop). THIS WORRIED ME because I am used more 'runny' batters. My results: 18 really moist/fluffy cupcakes, light flavor, not too sweet - I think any frosting will compliment this recipe. I noticed too that the liners were not saturated with grease/oil like in many recipes (box or scratch) previously tried. Baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. (I also noticed they looked kind like corn bread at the top when done.) The true test will be tomorrow - let's see how well they hold over night - I will put some in airtight container at room temp & a few others in fridge. Thanks for sharing! :)"
"2","4","My husband made this recipe with the suggestions written by clegg_connie, which were to use cake flour or substitute some of the all-purpose flour for cornstarch (I didn't have cake flour) and to increase the milk to 3/4 c and to add 1/2 tsp salt. It was his first time making a cake from scratch, and it turned out great! It was sweet and moist, and we actually ended up eating some of it without frosting because we didn't realize we were out of powdered sugar until he'd made the cake. So with these suggestions, it turned out wonderfully."
"2","4","Before I attempted this recipe I read several different reviews, a lot of the reviews stated the cake was dense and not fluffy at all, well I altered the recipe a bit and made cupcakes. I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 1 cup, 4tsp vanilla instead of 2tsp, and 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 of a cup. I tasted the batter and it tasted a bit like sugar cookie dough but it was lighter than after following the full recipe. After the cupcakes were finished, they did not puff up completely like most cupcakes do, however, they were still light and fluffy and still taste like sugar cookies .. I would call it a sugar cookie cake rather than white/vanilla cake... all in all, tasted good! I would make it again with the alterations :)"
"2","3","I have baked many cakes, this one came out dry.. I am looking for a nice, slightly dense, moist vanilla cake. This wasn't it."
"2","5","I've being using this recipe for a while now and it always turned out great. I usually double the recipe and the only change I made was increase the quantity of milk from 1cup to 1 1/2. It always turned out great both in taste and texture. Love it! However, still having trouble getting domed cupcakes out of this recipe exactly the way it is."
"2","1","This is more of a sweetened quick-bread than a cake. Too dense and not sweet enough and certainly not enough vanilla. Recipes like this one are what gives baking from scratch a bad name. It's the kind of cake one gets handed at a party and someone pop's over Aunt Betty's shoulder and raved she made it from scratch ' ISN'T IT GOOD!' Eye's watering you nod hoping that some sympathetic sob will hand you a glass of milk so you can choke it down before you have to attempt to speak. This recipe is bland bland bland. It would be more suitable for a shortbread to go with abundantly sauced strawberries and cream than passed off as a cake."
"2","5","Wonderful! Everyone raved about this cake at work. To accommodate allergies I did use Bob's Red Mill gluten free all-purpose baking flour and soy milk. I added a 1/2 t. each of salt and baking soda since the gluten free flour tends to not rise quite as well. Also added an extra 1/4 c. of soy milk per other reviewers. Turned out wonderful, and I'll definitely be using this one again!"
"2","5","this is by far the best cake recipe i have ever tried. i am sticking with it forever lol.made it in a 9inch pan and as cupcakes both were perfect.lets just say its a perfect batter, i made a few adjustments though...i use only half cup of sugar cos one cup was toooo sweet.i also use vanilla and butterscotch flavour. i stay in nigeria where the prefered milk is powdered (dry) so i used youghurt instead and the cake tasted so so so so yummy. my husband cant get enuf lol"
"2","5","I used 4 egg whites. Beat the whites separately until a peak forms and then fold them into the batter. I also increased milk by 1/4 and sifted the dry mixture three times. It is much lighter than the original recipe but does come out denser than a regular 'white' cake with egg whites. I am now making corn syrup frosting to put on the cupcakes. Make sure you fully cook the cupcakes. I undercooked them a bit, but otherwise they are delicious and extremely moist."
"2","5","Tried the recipe and it was great. I looked at the reviews and did add 1/4 cup more of milk due to mixing the batter it seemed a bit thick. I made them as cupcakes and it came out so light and fluffy. Awesome recipe!"
"2","3","This would be a 5 star recipe if the cake was a actually a white cake like I thought I was baking. But it's not. It's a spice cake with no spices added. It's a fantastic basic recipe and you can truly use it for a gazillion different things. So, if it was called 'basic cake' I'd give it 10 stars. Super moist and fluffy with a great crumb! I did add the extra milk that so many recommended and it definitely needed it. It would have been very dry without that. I used a phenomenal buttercream frosting recipe I found on another website. It was very edible and even delicious - just not what I was after when I searched for this recipe.   It would also be wonderful with buttermilk instead of milk. If I were spicing it up - which I may well next time, I'd just use nutmeg."
"2","2","Easy to make. Appeared moist when done but were oddly chalky/dry. Flavour was like raw pancake batter."
"2","5","Made this to use with fresh strawberries for Strawberry Shortcake-- family said it was THE BEST strawberry shortcake they had ever had! This cake cuts into 9 perfect sized pieces-- then split each piece horizontally so you can put some berries and cream in the middle as well as on top. I whipped some Organic Heavy cream--sweetened lightly with powdered sugar-- and it was perfect. I used a little more milk than the recipe calls for-- maybe more like 3/4 cup than 1/2. The cake is a perfect texture to stand up to the strawberries and juice. I even had a 'plain' piece-- and it is just perfect when you just want just a 'little sweet' something for dessert. A quick and easy cake-- there's no need to buy a 'mix' when you have this recipe! However-- this is NOT a 'white' cake-- it is definitely a 'yellow' cake-- but still good just the same. And with only two of us here most of the time-- a perfect sized cake so nothing goes to waste. Will try it with some chocolate (or other flavor) buttercream frosting next time."
"2","2","won't make it again -- just ok"
"2","2","I addedd the extra milk and made muffins. They looked nice, but were crumbly and tasted much like corn bread. Not light and fluffy as I was hoping. Would not consider this to be a white cake at all. Guess I'll keep searching for a good white cake recipe."
"2","5","This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I was a bit hesitant to make it at first because so many people were saying that cupcakes wouldn't turn out well but I decided to just go for it. This recipe is by far the best one I've used. I ran out of cupcake liners but I just greased the pan and they came out fine. I went a bit over 25 minutes but the cake is still very fluffy. The sides were pretty brown but that can't be helped since it was baked without a liner. Although, it does add a nice crunch to it and you don't have to get frustrated over peeling the liner. If you're more worried about looks, then you should use liners but I don't think I'm ever going to back to liners. Also, I found that you need to beat the mixtures really well with an electric mixer. It will give it that fluffiness that you just won't get by hand. I suggest you start the mixer on low and slowly raise the speed. That's really important. Especially with the butter, cream it up like there's no tomorrow. I actually ended up splattering it all over the table but that's only because I'm pretty incompetent with an electric mixer. I got the hang of it easily though; just hold the whisks(?) perpendicular to the surface. Seriously though, I can not stress this enough, mix it as much as you can. This recipe works perfectly for cupcakes and I would suggest you try it. They also hold their shape really well and didn't spill over at all even though I filled it pretty high. Try it before you decide not to do it.(:"
"2","4","It was kind of dry and sticky on the edges, in other words it was pretty good!"
"2","5","I recommend increasing milk to 3/4 c. and adding 1/2 t. salt if your butter isn't salted. I make cakes professionally and this recipe is great. Nice and sturdy for stacking, rich flavor for a white."
"2","4","This cake turned out really good, but I didn't follow the recipe exactly (so I can't give it 5 stars).   I combined a few reviewers suggestions... Cream the butter and sugar VERY well (5-8 min in stand mixer), scraping down occasionally. Beat in each egg VERY well (about 3 min. each). Add 1 tsp honey. Mix well. Alternate flour mixture and milk (used 3/4 cup) until well combined. Add 2 Tbsp. vanilla extract. Batter will be very light and fluffy."
"2","1","Not good at all. Its messing something. Not sure what. It came together fine and baked great but its just not good. The texture is way off."
"2","5","I made this into cupcakes using organic ingredients. It is a dense cake, more like a poundcake.Very yummy!!!!"
"2","4","It was a little dense and lacking in taste for me, but others really liked it. Turned out pretty."
"2","5","Oh my GOODNESS these are delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I took a couple other reviewers suggestions and added another 1/4 cup of milk. I also beat the hell out of the butter/sugar combo, then beat the hell out of it again after each egg, and after the flour/baking powder combo, and again after the milk. So, I suggest anyone trying this recipe to add the 1/4 cup milk and seriously BEAT THE HELL out of the mix!! 1 batch made 31 mini cupcakes and 10 normal sized ones. I baked the mini cupcakes for 15 minutes, and the large ones for 20ish minutes. Perfect!"
"2","5","Very good white cake recipe. I made cupcakes, nice crumb and texture and excellent flavor. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","4","really good is simple as the name described"
"2","5","This cake was delicious! Light and fluffy. I added an extra splash of milk as suggested by many other reviewers and it kept the cake moist. Lovely recipe, will be using it again!"
"2","5","I replaced 10% of the flour with cocoa powder and reduced sugar to 115g (for 12 servings recipe) to make a birthday cake for my neighbour's boy. It was very moist. Used Nutella whipped cream and Oreo cookies in the centre and coloured whipped cream and colorful marshmallows on the outside. The kids like it so much that they almost finished the 12' cake in just a while!"
"2","5","this is a really good cake, but it my be a good idea to heat it up in the microwave for 20 seconds after you put it in refrigerator, because it gets kind of hard."
"2","4","Pretty good cake! We made this following the directions exactly but used chocolate almond milk instead of dairy milk. It didn't make this a chocolate cake but definitely added a nice flavor. Moist but a little crumbly. Would make again."
"2","2","I wanted to use this recipe for cupcakes, but it went very poorly. The batter was still very thick and didn't fill the cups the way I hoped they would.  After they were out of the oven, they seemed okay, but the cake stuck to the sides of the cupcake liner. Overall, the taste was good, but I won't be using this recipe again."
"2","5","Used 3 egg whites, 3/4 cup white sugar. Turned out super moist, almost like angle food cake. My kids have made specific requests for this cake to made for their birthday. I made the fluffy white frosting that is on this website. A very delicious combination."
"2","5","I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my baby's first birthday party. I tripled the recipe and followed others advice adding an extra 1/4 cup of milk and an extra tsp of vanilla per 12 servings. Filled my cupcake liners 1/2 way using a decorating bag and tip and baked for 15 minutes. Ended up with 56 cupcakes--luckily I had enough liners. I was able to freeze the extras for another occasion. They were delicious! I would definitely use this recipe again!"
"2","4","This is such an easy and yummy recipe! It was neither dense or heavy, but very moist. As suggested, I used 3/4 liquid but substituted milk for almond soy milk and I used 3 eggs instead of 2. As directed, I blended everyhthing well. Because I was in the mood for lime, I blended in a packet of lime jello. I made cupcakes, but filled the cups a little too much a.d the cupcakes didn't dome, but were flat and spread out on top. That's okay, no biggie, I'll just fill less the next time. They were so tastey that my 16 year old son enjoyed one even before frosting!"
"2","5","This cake came out light and fluffy. The recipe is simple ans I wouldn't change anything. People were asking for more when I made these. Love these cupcakes!"
"2","4","Very tasty and makes a perfect amount of batter for a dozen cupcakes. I like to add a bit of plain yogurt (~1tsp) to keep it moist. This is also really tasty with the addition of some matcha (green tea powder)."
"2","4","Excellent recipe. I too added an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I will definitely use this recipe again. I also loved that the taste was not too sweet."
"2","5","I made this recipe and it was AMAZING. It melted in your mouth and was awesome. I thought the batter was a little dry and I didn't know what to add. So I added a 1/4 of whipping cream. That made it so much better!"
"2","5","Absolutely the easiest homemade cake I have ever made! I made a chocolate creamcheese icing....mmmmmmmm good! I added a smidging more vanilla. :)"
"2","2","I always go through reviews before baking something from allrecipes, and I saw that one reviewer noted that this recipe tasted like a sugar cookie. That reviewer was right. The cake smells great and has a nice, light texture, but I hate that it tastes like a sugar cookie. I don't really mind sugar cookies (though they aren't my favorite), but in this cake the sugar cookie taste completely turns me off. I will not be using this recipe again. However, for those who love sugar cookies, this is a good recipe for you."
"2","5","Add an additional 1/4cup of milk."
"2","5","This is definitely a 5 star recipe. I was thrilled with how this cake turned out. It reminds me of a pound cake. Delicious. I added fresh strawberries and cream cheese to make a great frosting. This is a keeper."
"2","2","I did not care for this. The cake tasted dry and flavorless. I gave it two stars because it was really easy."
"2","3","I beat my sugar and butter for 8 min. Used Egg Beaters for eggs and 1/2 c. Splenda/sugar mix. And, added 1/4 extra milk (1%). Usually, a good tasting batter will yield a good tasting baked good. This batter had a good consistency - not pourable but easily spoon-able. And the taste was wonderful. I marvel at how those ingredients taste like cornbread, but they do! The texture is a good wedding cake texture, however. Not too airy and not too dense. I made a butter-cream frosting and am eating a cupcake now. So, it is edible, plus, I like cornbread. Would probably be even better with a chocolate frosting (to better mask the cornbread flavor.)"
"2","2","Not good. I regret to write this review because I am an easy-to-please sweets lover. Others were right when they said it tastes like cornbread: same texture, but sweeter. Frosting does help."
"2","4","I was really nervous trying this recipe for the first time for a friend's birthday but it came out great. White and yellow cakes do tend to have that cornbread texture sometimes, but this one did not. I looked at many users' comments and came up with the following adjustments: I doubled the recipe to make a two-layer cake. I used 1 tablespoon of vanilla bean paste and 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of milk to the batter. I'm not sure if this is what really helped, but I beat the batter for a long time at every step before adding the flour (once you add the flour, only mix until the ingredients are combined). The cake was delicious, and although I over baked it a little bit (watch it carefully because it will go from under-cooked to over-browned very quickly!), it still turned out great. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Next time I'd like to try making cupcakes with it."
"2","2","I did not care for this cake. I followed the advise of beating the butter and sugar for 10 minutes and I added extra milk. It came out looking like cornbread and having the same texture kind of crumbly texture. The egg yolks also made it really yellow. While it tasted fine, it was not what I think of as white cake."
"2","3","takes more like 40-50 minutes to bake"
"2","5","My Mother and brother had gone out shopping on mothers day, so i baked tho cupcakes for my mom. They were super super easy, and my family loves them! I added a little over 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and that made them taste amazing. I also didn't think these were going to be good because while mixing it together it looked strange, but in the end it was amazing! Also follow the steps just the way it says and it will turn out great!"
"2","5","Great Cake! I made this for Mothers Day, and it came out perfect! not too dense! I did not have enough Baking Powder, so I was worried at first, but it came out fine! This cake is very good, and go's well if you put whipped cream and stawberries on top"
"2","5","I love this recipe.! I use it as my base for all my cakes."
"2","4","Fast and easy! I had everything on hand which kinda surprised me. The cake has great flavor. The only changes I made were : 3/4 cup of milk 1/2 tsp of salt 2 1/2 tsp of vanilla  It came out great, the only thing I didnt like was even after baking and cooling, the cake is sticky. Kinda weird."
"2","3","This recipe is just as many here described. It tastes like a sugar cookie and is a bit denser than many cakes. I like both of those qualities a lot. However, it's also a bit dry. I added 1/4 cup extra milk as some recommended to make it more moist, but it was still a bit dry for my liking. I will possibly use this recipe if I need to make some quick cupcakes or something for the kids, over using a boxed mix, but I think most would prefer a slightly more moist cake."
"2","5","totally scrumptious recipe... I won FIRST PLACE at our local grange competition! added a capful of almond extract to a deeper flavor... read the reviews and agree with beating the butter and sugar for between 5-10 minutes. Otherwise will be grainy. I tried it with both all-purpose flour and with cake flour... I preferred the cake flour, but the all-purpose was good too. Enjoy!"
"2","5","By far the best white cake recipe, I have made this countless times :) my kids school mates request them from my children :) and I made them for family members at easter time, two of whom were bakery managers !! and they were super impressed ! The only change I made is the milk for condensed milk !!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe !!!!"
"2","5","This cake was so great and easy!! I had bought strawberries on sale and wanted to use some up so omitted the milk and used 2 c. pureed strawberries instead, baked 50 minutes. Topped with chocolate mousse and hazelnuts. Delicious!!!!! Thanks for the recipe! This is one that I'm sure is great just the way it's written but is so simple it can be made in different varieties!"
"2","2","I was excited to try this recipe based on its simplicity. However, I was very disappointed in the taste. It was rather sweet and lacked any depth of flavor. That is why I could only give it two stars."
"2","1","It fell! ...while in the oven, just before it was ready to come out of the oven. In decades of baking, I have never had a cake fall before. There was no noise, or jolting of the stove....nothing....I have never had this happen...ever.. I followed the directions to the 'T'...."
"2","4","Very good a little to dense for my taste though so I will be moving on to a new recipe."
"2","5","My family love this, I did a big batch....like 40 I think for we had invite our whole family over for a bbq and i did them as a dessert, there was not even one crumb leftover."
"2","5","i compared the ingredients to this cake to Martha Stewart's recipe. they're both very similar. but i went with this one over Martha's because this one calls for 2 T more butter and 2 T less milk and i would for sure rather a buttery richer cake. This cake does however call for baking powder than Martha's. hers only calls for 3/4 t baking powder. so i did somewhat follow that modification. well, I used 1 teaspoon baking powder. too much baking powder will make cakes bitter. Overall this cake turned out delicious. It was dense yet still moist. Definitely not a fluffy cotteny cake. This is more wedding cake style, which i prefer. And i agree with jillian, it tastes like a sugar cookie-cake"
"2","5","I absolutely loved this cake! I made it for my sister's birthday a few weeks ago. I removed the baking powder and instead used baking soda, and didn't have any vanilla extract on hand so I used cocoa powder. It turned out great, even if it was dark, with a chocolaty taste. Great with icing, too! Maybe a bit hard shelled, but the inside was moist and delicious! I'll be using this in the future!"
"2","4","This recipe is good but needs work. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup milk. This resulted in a bland-ish cake. The crumb is very nice but it's missing something in the flavor department."
"2","5","I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup shortening, and added 3/4 teaspoon of salt. What a beautiful, light and fluffy basic cake! A great base for poke cake, shortcake, trifle...."
"2","3","I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before trying this recipe, so the cake came out dense and dry but the flavour was still amazing! Next time I will definitely beat the butter, sugar, eggs more, add 1/4 cup more milk, and add the dry ingredients alternating with the milk."
"2","5","great"
"2","4","Umm.... Still baking it!  Looks amazing + made delicious blueberry and strawberry sauce! Wow it's done!  Tastes .............. AMAZING! MUST TRY"
"2","5","GREAT!!!! Would not change a thing, worked great for my daughters birthday and she has picky taste."
"2","5","Delicious!! I made these for a birthday party and they were scrumptious! I used the recipe exactly and I couldn't have been more pleased. Definitely my new go-to white cake recipe!"
"2","5","I just put the cupcakes in the oven the dough was tasty so I'm sure the cupcakes will be too.....it was super to make. I did add extra vanilla and little extra flour and sugar. The dough tastes so good."
"2","4","This cake had a good flavor but was more like a cookie bar than a cake. I used 3/4 milk and beat everything good as suggested. I used Splenda and have to assumet his might be why mine wasn't light and 'fluffy'?"
"2","5","Love the recipe ! it is very similar to the white cake recipe from joy of baking . except that uses1 3/4 cup flour and 2 tsp baking powder.reading other reviews i also added 3/4 cup of buttermilk instead of what was given. I used the instructions in that:- 1. beat the hell out of everything , 2. separate my yolks and whites 3. mixed 50 gm of sugar with the whites 4 folded in my whites with the rest of the batter   The cake turned out to be delicious .I coated it with chocolate ganache for my dad's birthday , but i could've just eaten it as it is .Can't wait to make muffins outta it . anyone tried yet?"
"2","5","soo good"
"2","4","I made this cake today just to try it out. Following the directions exactly as posted left me with a very dense, pancake type batter. I added about a 1/4 cup of milk and a teaspoon of vegetable oil to the batter. I ended up with a light, fluffy, flavorful cake. I used a pre-made butter cream frosting, but it was too sweet. Does anyone have a suggestion for a not so sweet topping for this cake? I was considering cool whip."
"2","5","This is fantastic! I just made it as cupcakes to test it out and I will definitely be using this recipe for my daughters birthday cake! It tastes like a sugar cookie! I beat it well at every stage so I find it came out fluffy and not dense at all. I also used 3/4 cup of milk instead of half a cup as I live in Canada and with the higher elevation its a bit drier - turned out great. Can't wait to make this as a cake!!!"
"2","5","I tried this recipe with a cup of blueberries added to the mix and a spring form pan. I also substituted the butter with 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. It came out great and is super simple!"
"2","2","Very dense and not at all cake like - much, much too sweet. At least the kids enjoyed it but I will not make it again! I also added half a cup of milk as per the other reviews. This really isn't a 'cake' but much like a cross between a shortbread and a cornbread!"
"2","4","Very good! I've had problems in the past with getting my white cake to rise - usually problems with the difficulty of folding in beaten egg whites. I was looking for a denser, easier recipe, and this is it! It tastes delicious, too! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added an extra 1/4 cup milk, and was great. Thanks!"
"2","3","This cake tasted okay, but it did have the consistency of corn bread. Not sure if I will make it agian."
"2","5","Very nice cake. Lovely flavor and easy to make!"
"2","5","I made some adjustments. I added 3/4 cup more milk and if you can buy Mexican vanilla at a real Hispanic food store (it's less expensive that way) and has much more flavor than regular vanilla extract! I also added dry vanilla pudding mix. It really brought out the flavor. Hope this helps!!"
"2","5","This was the best cake recipe i have ever tried by far!!! Taste just like wedding cake!!! I will never by a boxed cake mix again!!!"
"2","5","I have been searching for the perfect cake to make for our 10th anniversary vow renewal and I have found it with this one I followed it to the tee and it turned out wonderfully it's not crumby at all and it was easy to ice. Even my husband who is not a cake fan said it was good. Thanks for sharing this recipe Scottsoman."
"2","1","I followed the directions perfectly but I ended up with an extremely dry and bland cake. Not sure where it went wrong?"
"2","5","i doubled the recipe with only 1.5 cups of sugar for 2 8' pans. (i did add a 1/4 tsp salt to flour, baking powder mix) i folded a pint of lightly sugared, hulled, and pureed strawberries. all ingredients at room temp. Whipped the butter and sugar 3 mins, added eggs 1 @ a time, alternated flour and milk in 3 portions, then the strawberry mixture. there in the oven now. look and smell delicious. 35 mins cooking time @ 350 in buttered, parchment lined, buttered again and floured pans. cooled 10 mins then onto wired racks until completely cooled"
"2","5","Let me start out by saying I wish there were more stars than just 5 , The first time I made this recipe I followed the original recipe I made cupcakes they came out awesome but I wanted them a little more moist so the next time I made this recipe I add a box of JELLO vanilla pudding and the cake came out even better everyone loves this when I make it so today is my son's 9th birthday im going to make his cake with this recipe it's the best!!!!!!!"
"2","5","I made cupcakes, not a cake, out of this recipe. The first time I tried, I didn't follow the instructions correctly and they came out too dry. The second time I made them was a huge success. I cooked the cupcakes for 20 minutes which was just enough, if not too much time. I could've probably left them in for 15-18 minutes and they would have come out fine—they came out crispy on top when I cooked them for 20. I would definitely suggest using a little bit more milk (I used 3/4 cups instead of 1/2), and ABSOLUTELY do not forget to use cupcake papers/liners (really cheap at any grocery store, only a dollar or two!) unless you want your cupcakes to stick to the pan! Unfortunately, I had run out of cupcake papers when I made them so they did stick, but other than that, these were delicious and EASY.  I absolutely recommend this recipe. It's not fabulous, but it's the easiest, most delicious cake recipe from scratch I have ever made. Go for it, but definitely don't forget to follow the directions in order like they say :) Good luck!"
"2","5","My husband don't really like cakes. but not to this cake. I bake it for my daughters 2nd birthday. it was delicious. all of our guest thought we bought it from the bakery lol!!! I bake so many cup cake but this is my first time bake a birthday cake and it turn out perfect. love it! love it! love it! thank you for the recipe."
"2","5","I have made this recipe a few times now, both for birthday cakes and cupcakes. It is wonderful! A delicious from-scratch recipe easy to make and easy to double. I baked a cake with this recipe and pured half the batter into a greased pyrex glass bowl and made a rounded ladybug cake! Really delicious. Going to make again for a birthday today. I used cake flour for a light fluffy cake."
"2","5","I found if you beat the eggs for awhile...until the butter and sugar come together with the eggs to be a soft whip, these are great! No cornbread like texture here. Let the eggs, milk, and butter come to room temperature before using. LOVE, LOVE, LOVED these! Thanks!"
"2","4","I made this easy recipe with my 7 and 10 year olds and it came out great! I added a big spoonful of sour cream to the recipe at the end after the milk and it ensured a fluffy, creamy and moist texture to the batter. Delish!"
"2","5","This recipe is AWESOME. I have used it to make my son's birthday and other event cakes for the last few years. It's simple and fun to use different kinds of frosting. Never dry, always perfect. I have tried a few changes and they never came out as good as the original recipe. Follow it to the letter and you won't be disappointed"
"2","5","I used this reciepe for my mini-cupcake maker. I just finished. These are fantastic. I added a little extra milk, as it was reccomended by others. Also I found that something was missing, a pinch of salt to interact with the baking powder to make it fluffier. I only prepared a half batch."
"2","1","Crumbly and they taste like cornbread. Never using this recipe again."
"2","5","its amazing"
"2","4","I made these and i put christmas sprinkles into it and the cake tasted good! but when i put the frosting on it threw off the flavor. i put just a little bit extra milk in so that it would be more moist and that was the best thing i could have done! all and all this recipe is very good. i enjoyed the cake!"
"2","4","Nice cake, very simple...but ours ended up tasting somewhere between white cake and cornbread. We followed the recipe just as written. No idea what happened there. It was better with the addition of some strawberry icing, but I'm still confused about the flavor."
"2","5","This was a real gem and super simple! Thank you. I needed to make a basic cake in a pinch with few ingredients. This was perfect. Careful not to overcook it. Mine was done in 30 minutes. A sure fire addition to my repertoire."
"2","5","This is a super simple cake! And really tastes like sugar cookie. I baked it and divided in two and spread some cool whip with cherry preserves. I took it to a party and it was the best dessert at the table! I used one 4 oz vanilla yogurt and brown sugar instead of white sugar. Came out fluffy and delicious! Yummy!"
"2","2","Disappointed! The only pro i have is that is has a good and fluffy texture but the flavor is just not good. The cake is cooked thru but the uncooked flour taste remains. I am baking a boxed mix instead of this right now!"
"2","5","Excellent taste, I love how easy this is. Next time I will add a 1/4 c. of milk extra because the batter was thick."
"2","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I remember trying it out couple of years back but then I didn't read the reviews and the cake didn't turn out great. This time I read the reviews, increased the milk and beat the mixture for few mins. Result was a batter that was so yummy that I licked uP quite a bit of it. And the cupcakes were such a hit!! I also mixed different colorings in the batter and made a beautiful marble cake. Really this cake is yummmmy!! Give it a try!"
"2","1","I filled the liners up only 2/3 the way full and they all puffed up huge and overflowed into each other. The cake does not taste like a normal white cake. It tastes like sugar cookies and has a very odd consistancy. Sugar cookies are yummy, but I wanted cupcakes!"
"2","5","This is a SUPER Simple and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! Don't know why anyone would give this less than 5 stars. I double this recipe and make birthday cakes with it. ALWAYS a Smash HIT! =D"
"2","5","I made this cake yesterday for my husband. His favorite cake has always been chocolate as he adores chocolate but I know that a white cake can be just as delicious so I took a look at this one and the recipe looked yummy so I tried this one. I had also looked at a few of the reviews on it and lots of folks just do their own thing and not really follow the recipe and I decided to just try this recipe as it is with just a wee bit more milk. My husband loves this cake! It is sooooo delicious with a lovely vanilla flavour. I love it too! Today at lunch was my husband's third piece of this cake and I asked him, 'between this cake and chocolate cake?' My husband thought for a few seconds and said, 'I think this one!' I saw lots of reviews that said they added shortening to the batter, jam to the batter, extra egg yolks, etc. but this cake recipe is perfect just the way it is. I would suggest that you beat it really well after each addition but other than that, I have no desire to change it! I made a delicious butter cream icing for it and they are perfect together!"
"2","1","This recipe was not to my liking."
"2","1","I would even give this half a star! I agree with another review It tastes like a giant pancake!! no flavor. The taste was not to my liking and I followed the directions exact!!!!!"
"2","1","I did the recipe exactly as the instructions ask, and ended with a cake that tasted more like a big pancake!"
"2","1","I have made this cake twice, one as cupcakes and the other as a cake and so far neither of them were good, It crumbles and is not moist. It has a cornbread texture and i would not recommend this recipe"
"2","5","This recipe gives the cake batter a better vanilla taste. Less artificial tasting."
"2","1","It isn't white cake if you use egg yolks; it is yellow cake. I was in a hurry and read rave reviews, so against my better judgement, I made it! I watched it get browner and browner, even at under the required time (not the oven; have a Wolf). Tooth pick came out wet. Never bothered with scratch white or yellow cakes (this one) before. Always trusted Betty C. or Duncan Hines, as they know those cakes! I know how to bake; degree in Home Ec (any one remember that degree?). Have a killer (too many calories to count) for chocolate 3 layer cake with gaunche through out, so know how to bake! Good luck to all, but keep looking for better recipe."
"2","5","I almost gave up on baking white/yellow cakes from scratch until i came across this recipe. I couldn't understand why my chocolate cakes, carrot cakes, and red velvet cakes came out so good, voluminous, and moist while my white or yellow cakes came out so dry and tasting like cornbread to my disappointment. So before i gave up i thought I'd scan allrecipes one last time for a good simple white cake! This is it! After reading most of the reviews, i took the advice of beating the butter well and then adding the sugar and beating it till fluffy. Have your cold ingredients at room temperature and make sure to use full fat milk! I also hand mixed the flour alternately with the milk so as to not over beat the batter. I decided to make cupcakes with my batter and they baked so perfectly. I couldn't believe my eyes. No more cornbread cupcakes!!"
"2","5","Super moist and delicious! The only thing I changed (per advice of other reviewers) is changed the amount of milk to 3/4 cup and the vanilla to 1 tablespoon. Delish!"
"2","3","I am a home baker and operate a cupcake business out of my home. I am searching for the perfect vanilla cake recipe. I tried this recipe twice and it turned out dry both times. I did not over beat or over bake it as I am quite aware of the effects those things have on cake. I just dont understand how others find this recipe moist. I am an avid baker and have acquired an amazing repertoire of moist cakes for my cupcake business; however, this one is not comparable."
"2","4","WOW! YUM!!!!! I love this!! I beat the butter and sugar & it came out fantastic!!! The reason for the 4 stars is that ut was so crispy around the DVDs, which normally I would love-however I was making a 2 layer cake (doubled recipe) & without freezing it first would hv been torture to frost.... But soooo yummy :P a keeper for sure :D"
"2","5","This was a fairly simple recipe that was very impressive. I baked it for my son's birthday, and everyone loved it! I used 'quick and almost professional buttercream icing' mixed with whipped cream to frost the cake. It was delicious, most and tasty. Also used 1.5 of the original recipe to fill a 9x13 pan. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"2","3","I didn't find this to be as good as everyone else thought it to be. I do have to agree with one of the reviews that I read though, it has a bit of cornbread taste and texture to it. It wasn't that sweet either. But if I do make this recipe again I would most definitely add maybe some vanilla pudding or something else. All together though I'm not that sure that I would make it again."
"2","5","This recipe is a hit with my son but we do a slight variation on it. We use 'Earth Balance' for the butter, 1/4 cup soy milk and add a ripe banana. We also slightly reduce the sugar and use Whole Wheat flour."
"2","4","The other reviews were right when they said this tasted like a sugar cookie cake. It was goood. My husband loved it. I cut them into different shapes and put chocolate frosting on them. Although it tasted really good and my husband really liked it, I wish it was more moist. I even followed the other reviews by making sure the sugar and butter were mixed well but it still wasn't the texture I wanted at the end. Maybe my expectations were too high."
"2","5","I was looking for a simple white cake and this really turned out great. It's moist and somewhat dense in texture. It tasted great with Chocolate frosting. The only adjustment that I made was I increased the milk to 3/4 cup as was suggested by others. YUMMY!!!"
"2","3","I am trying to find a white cake recipe to serve at my twins first birthday party in two week. The recipe was easy to make but as others have noted it is very dense and tastes kinda like cornbread. We decided to keep looking for a better cake."
"2","5","LOVE this recipe! Fast, super easy and devine. Highly recommend. YUM :)"
"2","4","I liked this recipe. It is a little denser (little like pound cake) than your typical white cake mix batter. I added a little more milk for a looser batter and I think it helped keep them moist. It's so easy that I'm sure I'll be making these again. I didn't have ingredients for frosting, so dipped them in the 'Vanilla Glaze' recipe. I would add a citrus zest/juice to the glaze or dust them w/powdered sugar, but frosting would be the best, in my opinion."
"2","4","Really, good, but you could cut the sugar possibly in half and they'd be fine. I found them very sweet. I also accidentally put in too much baking powder, so my cupcakes were very puffy - looked great!"
"2","5","The texture of this is so smooth people think that this comes from a box! My daughter loves to make this with mom or dad. A family favorite!"
"2","5","This recipe was easy & came out great! What I liked was that it rose evenly & wasn't real sweet which worked out great w/ buttercream icing. Will definitely be making again!"
"2","5","Really amazing! I ran out of vanilla extract so I added pure almond extract along with some fresh vanilla beans. I topped this with a lemon glaze which I made from fresh lemon juice and some icing sugar.  This was a hit and I cant wait to make it again & again!"
"2","5","I made cupcakes using this recipe and people would not stop talking about how much they loved them! I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 cups of ALMOND MILK(unsweetened vanilla) because it was all I had and it turned out great! I used a tad less vanilla extract due to the extra vanilla flavor in the milk though.  For the frosting I cheated and bought the Trader Joe's white frosting mix (it is easy and simple! just add butter and a little water). After a taste test and discovering that the cupcakes did in fact taste like sugar cookies, I sprinkled CINNAMON SUGAR on the top and it was the best idea i've had all month. The frosting really made the whole thing come together perfectly! WARNING YOU CAN'T HAVE JUST ONE!!!"
"2","5","This recipe is the same as the one on allrecipes.co.uk and is delicious! I made it with my friend and it is stunningly good! A 5 star recipe for sure! Really great. Easy for children as the instructions aren't difficult."
"2","4","This was very tasty and moist but didn't rise as high as I hoped."
"2","5","LOVE THIS! So simple and tasty, by far on of the best cakes I have made. I topped it with a vanilla icing, and a small strawberry. Delicious(: I love it! I also tested all different toppings, ranging from cinnamon, to a lemon wedge, powdered sugar, regular sugar, grahm cracker dust, and it really makes the cupcake. But, they taste amazing just plain too(:"
"2","2","I've been making the same old white cake recipe that my great grandmother gave me and I wanted to see what was out there. With all the rave reviews I thought this one would be perfect. Boy was I wrong. This cake, in my family's opinion, tasted awful! I loved the density, but it was just missing the traditional 'sweetness' of a white cake."
"2","5","I have searched for a good homemade vanilla cake recipe and have found it. This cake is super yummy and as another reviewer said, it tastes just like a sugar cookie. The trick I believe is to beat the creamed misture for a good length of time. I did about 10 minutes w/my KitchenAid. Great, easy recipe!"
"2","5","I'm usually a chocolate cake girl but this was excellent for homemade white cake. The only alteration I made is added an extra teaspoon of vanilla for more of a vanilla flavor. I liked this better than the red velvet cupcakes that I also made. These were light, fluffy, and super tasty! Especially with chocolate frosting. ;) Thanks!"
"2","5","I usually don't make time to write reviews but I decided I could for this recipe. I was very happy at how simple it is. Just like the title. And....It tasted AMAZING! My mother, who says she doesn't like white cake, actually wanted to try some of this one. She even came back for more! Then she kept praising it all night long and even the next day! I will definitely be making this again!"
"2","5","I love to make cupcakes and I have been searching forever for the perfect recipe. I've made countless batches of bland, flavorless, dense cupcakes. This recipe is simply amazing. The cake stays moist and the top crisps up just a bit, giving the overall cupcake a great bite! I made these last night for a Bachelorette party I'm hosting this weekend (I put the in the freezer until Saturday morning) and I tried them without icing them first and thought they were fabulous on their own. I didn't change the recipe at all (only doubled it to make 24) and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing this with us! It's going in my book!"
"2","5","its an amazing cake,, i added also juice of one orange,, and some of its zest,,, it tasted sooo good,, they loved it!! i didnt find a single piece for the next day breakfast!"
"2","5","i love this recipe! its moist and everyone loves it!=) wouldn't change anything"
"2","1","Not a good white cake. I agree with the other posters that it tastes like cornbread, heavy and dense with a very mild flavor. This recipe didn't call for any salt, which it needs badly, I added some but it wasn't enough. It really lacks a solid flavor and it needs more milk. I, like the others, added 1/2 c. more milk but next time I would add even more. I can tell this recipe has potential but it will take a lot more tweaking."
"2","5","This cake is simple to make and delicious. I didn't bother following the directions as far as adding ingredients is concerned. I threw everything in the bowl, mixed it up and dipped the batter into a lined muffin tray. The cupcakes came out moist, soft and delicious!"
"2","5","I made this as cupcakes. I am a novice cook and found this super easy. Just enough for 12 cupcakes, and they were done in just under 25 minutes. I actually made a vegan version with Ener-g egg replacer, vanilla soy milk (which added a little extra vanilla and sweetener), and Smart Balance. I followed the advice of earlier reviewers and added a little extra milk -- I put in somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 cup. I also used a mixer and made sure I beat it very well. They turned out very well -- fluffy and delicious."
"2","3","I'm on the hunt for the perfect white cake to make cupcakes for my parent's 40th anniversary. I scaled this recipe down to just make a few cupcakes to try out and I have to say I'm disappointed. Normally I love cake that is dense and has some body to it, but this was was more like cornbread. It didn't taste terrible, but it wasn't great either. I used other people's suggestions too. It wasn't dry, but just not the texture that I'm looking for. I will keep on looking."
"2","5","Great basic recipe. Nice base for changing it up - adding a bit of cinnamon and topping with cinnamon sugar topping for snickerdoodle cake, using with berries...endless possibilities here. I do prefer it as cupcakes!"
"2","5","Everyone in my family loved this cake. Used heavy whipped cream in lieu of frosting. Easy to make and even easier to eat!"
"2","5","This was my first time baking a cake. It turned out really delicious! It turned out to have the thickness of a pound cake which I really love. I'm glad I choose this as my first cake recipe to try! I added 3/4 cup milk, a full tablespoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of vegetable oil. The only thing that did not turn out well, was that it did not rise as much as I hoped, but maybe because I baked at too low of a temp."
"2","5","I made this cake for a double baby shower and everyone raved about it, I had about 3 people ask for the recipe. Made the cake in a baby rattle shape and used buttercream icing recipe from this site as well. Made both as recipe states and flavored the icing.   By far the best cake I have ever made definitely a keeper!"
"2","5","Oh my goodness, that is good cake. I made these into cupcakes and they are good even without frosting. WOW. I also used 3/4 cup milk and a tad more vanilla. Awesome cake!!"
"2","5","Absolutely amazing! The taste was phenomenal! It didn't taste dry at all. I will make this again."
"2","5","Easy. Wonderful. Didn't change anything. We ate it cubed with ice cream and fruit (no frosting). Will certainly make again."
"2","4","I just made this cake and have to say the taste was very good. I did like other people said and beat it nearly to death, which helped and add a full TBSP vanilla and extra milk. My only problem is that it didn't rise, it was still moist, light and delicious but a little flat. Otherwise it was perfect. I did use cake flour instead so am thinking that could have been the problem but it made the cake even nicer so I would do it again."
"2","5","Really moist and tasty! Added sprinkles for a home made version of confetti cake. :)"
"2","5","I have been using this recipe for the base of all my cupcakes in my soon to be cupcake bakery. This cake is amazing but I do agree it needs some tweaks. I use cake flour or self rising flour instead of all purpose flour. It gives it some more rise. Also make sure to mix the butter and sugar together for at least 6 minutes then add one egg at a time and mix for another 6. I also add an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract for more flavor (try using almond or lemon extract for a different taste) Adding an extra 1/4 cup of milk is an absolute must! Also if your cake comes out too dry, try putting it in the freezer for 45 minutes, just dont forget to take it out! I will be using this recipe for a long time! I absolutely love it!!"
"2","4","This is good simple white cake. I had to keep it in the frig due to the frosting I used, which made it a bit denser than it should have been, but that is not the fault of the recipe."
"2","3","I made it exactly like the recipe and it had good taste but dry. Not just a bit dry but pass me a glass of milk NOW kind of dry. My 8 yr old said it tasted like cornbread, which he loves so he liked it. I have found other white cakes that I like either. I will give this cake one more chance and make it with more milk like others suggested and will update this review."
"2","2","I don't know how to describe the taste of this but...I'm not happy with it. I've had such a hard time finding a simple white cake recipe that tastes good. Maybe I'll just do boxed when I'm making white cake.  We ate them as cupcakes with homemade chocolate frosting. It offset the bland taste of the cake."
"2","3","This cake recipe was just ok. It came out perfect, but was kind of bland and a little too sweet."
"2","2","There was way to much vanilla extract for my liking. Not a very good recipe."
"2","4","My husband and I loved this white cake. Turned my into cupcakes and they were very light and not to heavy. They came out moist and had a good vanilla taste to it. Topped mine with strawberry cream cheese frosting. YUMMY!!! Thanks for this recipe, will be my new recipe for white cupcakes."
"2","5","Sooo simple to make and It's so tasty. It taste just like madeline cookies......only better. I tried to make it a little less sweet. I put a little less than 1 cup of sugar & not quite 1/2 of butter."
"2","5","Excellent and simple."
"2","5","Great cake! I took the advice of the other posters and used 3/4 cups of milk and they came out great!"
"2","5","Excellent. The texture of this cake is so far superior to anything you could get out of a box. Plus, the ingredient list is so short and so simple, I don't know why anyone would use a mix. The amount of cake was a bonus for me since this was just a small birthday celebration for my family of 5 but it would be really easy to double for a larger crowd."
"2","4","WOW! I agree that it should be 4.5 stars! I had to find a vanilla cupcake recipe at the last minute for our daughter's school birthday party. This did the trick! I, too, added a touch more vanilla and 1/8 cup extra milk. They are delicious!"
"2","5","Love, love, love this cake recipe!! I made it to go into a trifle and it turned out spectacular! Super fluffy and moist with just the right touch of sweetness and flavor that a cake like this should have. I did follow the other reviewers advice and creamed the butter and sugar for about 10 minutes with my hand mixer until it was very fluffy. Then I was careful to fully incorporate the eggs one at a time. I also sifted the dry ingredients and added them slowly. In addition, I did up my milk to 3/4 of a cup(I used 2% milk). Definately recommend this recipe! Yum!"
"2","5","Simple. Came out as expected. Thanks!"
"2","1","Flat cake - barely rose. Whipped butter for 10 minutes until almost white. Doubled recipe, separated eggs and whipped whites gently as one reviewer suggested to get loft, added separately and still, flat flat flat! I'm sure it will taste fine but bummer, might have to now make a third layer to make it look like a proper birthday cake."
"2","5","This is so moist and fluffy! It was amazing and totally blew me away! At first I was hesitant because you add in the milk last. Before I added in the milk it was a dough like substance. But then I added it in and it was all good."
"2","4","I will use this again as a base. Great flavor and easy to make."
"2","4","Made it 'as is' and it wasn't as moist as I would like. I added 1/8 cup of extra milk and it was much better. Make sure you really beat the eggs-if not-it doesn't come out well."
"2","5","Super easy and very delicious. I made cupcakes out of it. The batter was very thick and fluffy and the cake came out moist and fluffy. I took out 1/2 tsp of vanilla and added 1/2 tsp almond extract, which gave it a good rich taste. The top had crystallized sugar on it, which I thought was really good and interesting, as I've never seen this before. Great recipe!!"
"2","5","Love this recipe and so easy to make! I wanted something easy to make for this coming easter holiday and added a few extra ingredients, instead of vanilla extract I used 1tsp. of lemon extract and 4tsp. of peach juice that comes in the canned peaches. I also melted down 1/3 cup of white chocolate and incorporated that with the milk. Then I poured the peaches into a bowl and mixed with 1tbls of brown sugar and 1/2tsp of lemon extract and set aside to soak the flavors. I then got finely chopped walnuts and brownef them in butter in a saucepan then caramalized with brown sugar. When the cake was a bit firm I pulled it out and added some of the peach juice brown sugar mixture on top with a brush then added the peaches on top (i chopped them up). Then I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar over the peaches then added the walnuts then added more of the peach juice brown sugar mixture. Popped it back in the oven for 10 more minutes and the top gets a nice glaze. It came out super moist and so yummy!"
"2","5","This was soo good! whipped butter/sugar 8 min and 3 T's vanilla as suggested. I doubled recipe without prob's other reviewer's had to make layered cake. Make with One Bowl Buttercream Frosting from this site and topped with strawberries and blueberries. Everyone here gives it 10/5 lol. Leftovers usually go to neighbor but kids won't let me this time- its that good."
"2","5","Simple ingredients, simple to make! Delicious is a bonus! Like other reviewers, I mised the heck out of the butter and sugar stage, each egg, and then added the rest. Also, because I was in the mood, I added a box of sugar free strawberry jello mix to the butter/sugar stage. Vanilla buttercream frosting and viola!"
"2","4","I thought this was a great recipe, if you're expecting something gourmet this isn't it but if you're looking for a simple recipe that you can play around w/ & make it personal for many occasions this is it. My 11 yr old made these almost all by herself & we beat the tar out of each addition till everything was light & fluffy. She added mini chocolate chips & made the Cool Whipped Frosting from this sight to top them with & it made a sweet Sunday treat for everyone. So versatile you can do practically anything with this. We did up the milk to 3/4 c but other than that we followed the recipe exactly."
"2","3","I hate to say this, but as an earlier reviewer pointed out ... they tasted like pancakes. Sweet pancakes, but pancakes nonetheless. It *is* a very easy recipe, but oh so sorry, we simply didn't care for it."
"2","1","Came out dry like corn bread =( Fail."
"2","5","LOVED IT!... whipped eggs and batter just like other user said and the cupcakes were to die for!... I added a cheescake filling and a strawberry glaze icing!"
"2","3","Husband loved it. It is very sweet! wouldn't make it as a cake again, just for cupcakes with a whipped cream frosting!"
"2","5","Made a trial run for my sons 1st bday last week when some friend were coming over. I added chocolate chips and a little more vanilla (I love vanilla)along with a chocolate butter cream recipe from this site. Everone loved them, even thoses that don't usaually like cake. Thanks for sharing"
"2","4","Cake was very flavorful but dry."
"2","5","Once again for about the 5th time using this ever awesome recipe, they come out moist and have a great flavor! Still 5 Stars! ....Easy and excellent recipe! My 12 year old made these all on her own and they came out wonderful and delicious! Thanx for sharing!"
"2","1","This recipe was terrible!!! It was easy to make but had that floury taste that puts off everybodys taste buds. Add more sugar when you make it otherwise you'll get a floury mess. Otherwise though good attempt"
"2","5","I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar because I thought it would go better with the frosting I was using. Following the advice of one of the posts, I made sure that the butter/egg/sugar mixture was beaten until fluffy. I also added about 1/4 cup extra milk. The cupcakes turned out amazing!"
"2","5","The most delicious white cake ever!I added some strawberry jam for the topping and it was Devine!"
"2","5","I just made this cake today and after few changes (I add half of milk and half of crema espesa from Nestle wich is half and half and I used cake flour stead of AP) and It come out great, very moist and tender for more flavorful cake I used vanilla beans. The only thing I would add next time is adding more eggs for help with the structure of the cake since i pretend to frost this cake for a birthday party and cover it with fondant.  I will post another review about the next. So thanks so much for the recipe ist a good base for any other flavors. one."
"2","5","I followed this exactly as listed and it turned out awesome! Not dry at all it was nice and moist."
"2","5","LOVE this recipe!! It makes the best, most moist cupcakes ever!!"
"2","3","I didn't care for this recipe but my husband really liked it. I made cupcakes, and used Cool Whipped Frosting found here on allrecipes"
"2","1","This cake tastes like cornbread!! Do not pay attention to the other 'good' reviews! It isn't terrible, but I just made this for my daughter's 1st birthday party and I am very disappointed. I am really hoping that some vanilla buttercream frosting on top will distract my guests from the fact that it could double as a side to chili."
"2","5","My nine year old son made this using tapioca flour instead of wheat flour and it was fantastic! He even said they were flavourful enough on their own that they didn't need icing! Fast, simple, and the results are always fantastic - moist and delicious!"
"2","5","DELICIOUS! I made this with a strawberry filling..... So wonderful!"
"2","3","I made cupcakes and they didnt rise up much like others that i have made but with a cream cheese frosting they turned out to be pretty tasty."
"2","3","Perhaps is it me, but I found this a very blah recipe and nothing special. Was looking for something lovely and moist and found it just so so."
"2","5","I make this all the time, as cupcakes. I did do what others suggested and added 1/4c extra of the milk. I also ensured the butter and sugar was creamed very well, and again beat very well after each egg. Doing this each time I've made them has had them come out great every time!"
"2","4","This was my first attempt making a cake from scratch, and I will be making it again!! It was the first cake I'd ever made that didn't end up with a giant hump in the middle! As other reviewers recommended, I took their advice to just beat the heck out of it after every addition, making sure it's really fluffy and creamy. It does need just a little more milk as the batter was a little stiff. I will make this again, but next time I'll do it 1 1/2x recipe, as I tried it in a 10' Springform pan. Second, lower the temperature to 325 or 300 and bake for longer, so the ouside doesn't brown as much. I can't wait to make this for guests and special occasions!!!!! =)"
"2","5","Great recipe! Never going back to box cake mix again. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","4","This was a delicious cake, though a bit denser than what I am used to. I made rainbow cupcakes from this mix and they were well liked by the others members of my drama team. Thanks so much!"
"2","5","I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS RECIPE, IT WAS VERY EASY & MY HUSBAND LOVED IT, MY CUPCAKES WERE FLUFFY AS WELL AS LITE! THANK YOU......"
"2","5","Very flavorful and dense. Excellent with 7 minute frosting."
"2","4","This is my go-to for white cakes and cupcakes! Fantastic with french vanilla icing and candies or licorice on top."
"2","4","This recipe is perfect for a small recipe when you are craving a sweet treat and don't have a cake mix on hand. I always love cooking for scratch when I have the chance."
"2","5","Was a huge hit with the cupcakes I made out of it! It was a tad too sweet for me with the frosting I used, but everyone else didn't mind."
"2","2","Didn't turn out to be that great, had to cover up the cake with custard (to cover the taste of baking powder) as I had to make this in a jiffy, the cake cooks in like 25-30 mins so you might have to keep a close eye on it, baking powder can be reduced and the milk/ water can be a little more say 3/4 cup. All in all wouldn't make this again"
"2","4","The batter was ready in just 5m! I didn't even need a electric mixer. I made it all by hand, and it turned out fairly dense but they are still delicious! It seemed like there was too much vanilla in the batter, so next time I'll reduce that a bit. Also, they needed to be in the oven for about 5 extra mins, and they're still very moist. They made my house smell like a bakery and now I get to decorate them with vanilla frosting, a drizzle of dark cocoa mint candy melts and peppermint sprinkles (for -christ-mas). Definetly my new 'base' cupcake recipe!"
"2","5","When I was making this cake, the batter itself was getting way too dense, so I added some additional splashes of milk to thin it out a bit [not too much that it would become watery]. I also left out some sugar because I like my cake to be somewhat guilt free. I baked it in with some toasted almonds and cranberries as well as about 2 tsps of orange extract. Mmnnmn, tasty. =)"
"2","4","It really is a simple recipe - easy to make with a bare minimal variety in the required ingredients. I followed the other reviewer's recommendations in adding a little bit for milk and the results were good - just moist enough to my liking. The surface of cupcakes browns and hardens, sort of like sugar cookies. Overall, great basic recipe! I will definitely be using this for many other occasions."
"2","1","I followed the directions and I didn't like the taste. The cake fell when I took it out of the oven and tasted like dense sawdust. I had other people in the house taste it and they agreed. I would have been better off using a cake mix."
"2","5","yummmmmm! this is such a delicious cake. I just followed what others wrote about mixing everything really well and add 1/4 extra if milk and it turned out perfect! it is a very sweet cake and you dont even need icing, but i really like sweet stuff so it is perfect for me! Will deffinately be making this for my sons 2nd birthday!"
"2","5","I loved this. Very easy to make, basic recipe that can be worked to suit your needs. I added hundreds and thousands, pastel pink and purple icing and glitter icing for the letters to each, then turned it into a 'Birthday balloon' cake made of cupcakes. Strong vanilla flavour but that was definately a hit. I'll be using this recipe in the future for most if not all my cakes."
"2","4","Made this recipe into cupcakes today. Thought they were pretty good. Used suggestions from others. Inused half butter and half shortening. Used a little more milk and hand stirred the flour and milk in. I alternated the milk and flour, ending with the milk."
"2","3","I've made these twice-- it is a delicious recipe, for sure, and excellent for a cake, especially a layer cake, but it is way to flat for cupcakes. they don't make a dome shape at all, and half of the cupcake gets burnt onto the tin."
"2","1","I tried this Cake recipe and it had a good flavor, but it was very dry and was more of a pound cake texture.. I dont think I will use this recipe again..."
"2","5","very moist, but cut the sugar in half."
"2","4","these were good. a great base for a fantastic frosting or funky decorations."
"2","4","This was really good. I also upped the milk a bit based on other reviews! Great to use for a birthday when there are only 4 of us here - less waste!"
"2","1","This did not turn out well! Now, with all the good reviews, it was probably something i did. But, i won't be making it again. =("
"2","4","Great white cake recipe! It was so simple to prepare and did not use alot of ingredients, which was prefect for a quick cake. The cake itself was plenty moist and was not dry at all. I made a frosting with brown sugar to put on the cake and it was excellent. Recipe saved!"
"2","2","Followed recipe as was...Didn't like texture - heavy..will not make again...sorry"
"2","5","So simple and good. Great for when your having a sweet craving. Common ingredients your bound to have in your pantry."
"2","5","This was the most WONDERFUL cake ever!!!!!! So easy to make, and soo tasty! I will never use another recipe again! Even the batter was DELISH!!!!!"
"2","3","This cake was easy to make and tasted good but after it sat in the refrigerator overnight it was really dry & I was disappointed. I should have added more milk. I was wondering about it when I put it in the pan because it was so thick. It's a good decorating cake because it's heavy but I would have preferred it less dry."
"2","5","I had some buttercream icing to use up and thought I'd try making a white cake for the first time. I'm so glad I did because this cake is gorgeous. Made it twice within a week. I did follow suggestions and upped the milk about 1/4 cup. Other than that followed the recipe exactly, used up my buttercream icing and topped it off with crushed almonds and grated chocolate. Family raved. Thank you for a great recipe!"
"2","5","I've made this recipe several times. Makes great cupcakes and bunt cakes! I use coconut oil istead of butter though (same amount)."
"2","1","I tried this cake and did not care for it, I will NEVER EVER bake this cake again!!!!!!!"
"2","5","Just amazing! Used it for a birthday cake and will make cupcakes with it next time. Thanks for sharing!"
"2","4","I made these as directed and thy were wonderful! My second batch, I added food coloring and made rainbow cupcakes. Really moist and light."
"2","2","Reading the reviews that said it was dense and dry, I substituted in 2/3 cake flour instead of AP flour in hopes of a flufflier cake AND added 1/4 cup more milk. The result? The cake was not dry, but still dense! Not using this recipe anymore even though it was simple."
"2","2","This recipes barely gets 2 stars! I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with flat, dry, crumbly cupcakes. Yes, I creamed the butter and sugar well. No, my baking powder was not expired. I bake all the time, so I know what I'm doing. I just think there are better recipes out there to try."
"2","5","I used this for a wedding cake (my first) for 175 people, and it got rave reviews! Definitely moist, but not too heavy. I added a bit of almond extract for the trial cake, and a little lemon extract for the actual wedding cake, and both were great."
"2","4","My first everm to bake a cupcake! Delicious & the sugar was great, not too sweet or less sweet! Thanks!"
"2","5","This recipe worked wonderfully for me. This is the first cake I have baked from scratch and my family are now huge fans of my baking!"
"2","5","This cake is simple and decadent. my new go to white cake recipe!"
"2","4","Simple but delicious. I needed a cake quickly and this did the trick. I used a 8X3 cake pan and I was able to tort the cake into two layers for a nice size cake. This will be my go to cake from now on since you can customize it to your needs. :D"
"2","5","I made this recipe last week and just doubled the recipe to make 2 - 9' round pans. It was one of the best white cakes I have ever made. My family had it polished off by the end of the night. Very moist and fluffy. I'm making it again for my daughter's birthday this weekend."
"2","4","added a touch of almond extract, delish!"
"2","5","this was easy and delicious. It's late, wanted some cake and was feeling very lazy so I did the whole thing in the food processor. i only had medium eggs and yeah, the batter was thick, so i threw in an extra egg. while it was baking i read reviews and saw that some people complained about a dry dense cake, so i did a glaze instead of a frosting, combined 1/4 c milk, 1/4 c butter, 1/4 c sugar and 1/2 c coconut in a pan, boiled till thicker, and poured it over the cake while it was still hot. I doubt if it NEEDED extra moisture, but it was a delicious addition! couldn't wait for the cake to cool so we ate it hot with iced tea ~ perfect! This IS a yummy easy cake!"
"2","4","Best homemade white cake recipe I've ever used. I did take other reviewers advice and added an extra 1/2 cup of milk. Also added an extra teaspon of vanilla just because I love it. I will most definitely use this recipe again."
"2","1","this cake is not good :("
"2","4","I would not us this recipe for cupcakes. This taste like a pound cake. It's very dense and a bit dry. Pretty good with my morning coffee though..."
"2","1","Tasted like a sugar cookie, made into a cake. Very disappointed :( The texture was crumbly and dry. Not good at all..."
"2","5","This cake recipe is delicious. I used pure cane sugar (vegan) instead of white sugar, egg replacer instead of eggs, vegan butter instead of butter and almond milk instead of milk. I made the cake completely vegan using this recipe but with replacements. It is so good. And has no cholesterol, great for people wanting to eat heart healthy. The non-veggie people in my family love it! My mom is on a diet so this is something she says she doesn't have to feel guilty about eating a slice. It even appeased my little brother's 9 year old taste buds! I recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone. Best cake I have ever had."
"2","5","Really easy cake to make-all ingredients were in the house and simple to put together-A1 recipe"
"2","5","Wonderful! I made some VERY strong chai with the milk and added some cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon to the batter. It was FANTASTIC! Like a spice cake. I also added cinnamon to a vanilla buttercream frosting."
"2","5","I was looking for a good chai cupcake but couldn't find one, instead; I used this recipe but brewed 2 bags of chai tea into the milk before adding it, and they turned out great!"
"2","5","A hit with the entire family. Even the pickiest eaters. Made in a muffin pan, then also another as an 8x8 cake! Try a little frosting on top and its perfect!!!"
"2","4","Very good taste but it was a bit dry for me. I think next time I'll add a little extra milk as someone suggested."
"2","2","tastes like pancakes"
"2","5","exactly as the name implies, this is a great simple cake. it uses ingredients i always have on hand, and whips up quickly and easily without much fuss. i've used this recipe for cupcakes as well as 8x8 square cakes. it comes out great, and seems to pair up well with any kind of frosting. thanks!"
"2","2","Not complicated and easy to make. However, the cake is very dense and a little tasteless. Good cake for stacking when you need more structure, but not great tasting. Also- takes longer to bake than stated- a lot longer. I had to turn the oven down to prevent burning the outside of the cake! I might try tweaking a little, but more than likely would not make again."
"2","3","I was excited to try this cake after reading the reviews but was disappointed with results. Recipe was quite easy & I followed it exactly but it turned out very dry. If I try it again - I'll add extra milk like some of the reviews said. Not sure what was wrong - maybe it's just the high altitude here."
"2","5","I too beat the sugar, butter and eggs for 10 minutes and added and extra 1/4 c milk and the cupcakes turned out perfect. Great recipe will make again."
"2","5","I searched for a simple white cake, something quick to use up the buttercream frosting I had leftover from a baby shower. This recipe is fantastic, and I didn't even have all the right ingredients on hand! I will use this recipe for all of my birthday cakes from now on. Upon reading some of these fine suggestions, I decided to add that extra 1/4 cup of milk, since I had only 1 egg. Also, I used bread flour since it was all I had, and since I was out of regular margarine and had not enough butter, I used shortening. I used an 8' springform pan lined with parchment, sides greased lightly with unsalted butter, and baked for about 45 minutes. For the finishing touches I used up the white buttercream, sprinkled graham crumbs around the edges, with a garnish of chocolate chips surrounded by sliced almonds in the center. Perfect! I believe the secret to the success of this cake is to take the time and really beat it well with a mixer. Thank you. My special occasion baking just got a whole lot simpler~"
"2","3","Very dense, not fluffy at all. Added an extra 1/4 cup milk as the consistency of the batter was very thick."
"2","5","easy! moist! i used raw sugar and it worked just fine. i also defrosted about 1/3 cup frozen berry medley (blueberry, blackberry and raspberry) and folded it into the batter. i didn't use frosting and it came out absolutely delicious."
"2","4","I didnt have any consistancy problems but the taste was a little different. It wasnt very cake like tasting. More like a corn bread....but very easy"
"2","4","Light, fluffy and not too sweet. The flavor leaves room for rich frosting."
"2","3","Well, I don't know what I did wrong....but they did not turn out pretty in any way and basically melted in the cupcake tins. I also don't agree that the flavor was fantastic. I'm not sure I would try this recipe again but I'm happy others didn't have the bad luck I did!"
"2","5","I love this super fast recipe. I follow it to a 'T' and do not change anything and use it for muffins: add a few berries, rhubarb, or chocolate chips...it always turns out really well...this is a keeper for me and my family."
"2","5","No complaints here! This cake turned out really good. I made cupcakes (yeilded 14-15 'regular' sized) and the kids LOVED them! Not too sweet, great flavor. I'll definitely use this recipe again."
"2","5","This cake is excellent. It may take a little longer than mixing one up from a box but the taste is so much better. I've decided real recipes are worth making and this is million times better than a boxed cake. Delicious for cake or cupcakes. This one is a keeper. I only use REAL butter. Thanks for this recipe."
"2","4","Really good cake recipe! Totally recommend it for new bakers."
"2","5","I modified this recipe a bit and it turn out amazing. I put 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 and before I added the milk I soaked a raw vanilla bean in the milk for about 4 hours. I scrapped out all the seeds in the vanilla bean to get the little black flecks throughout. I read that this recipe was alittle dry, so in addition to the extra half cup milk, I also put 1/4 cups of Hot water to moisten it up. I added a 1/4 tsp of salt and they turned out AMAZING. Very delicious."
"2","5","These are unbelievable! I doubled this recipe. The only changes I made was increasing the milk as the other reviewers suggested and using 1/2 t. almond extract with the vanilla- just because I didn't have enough vanilla once the recipe was doubled. The cupcakes I made were light, fluffy, and moist. Much better than boxed! I used my KitchenAid paddle to mix and made sure everything was well combined before adding the next ingredient. Thank you for my new go-to cake recipe!"
"2","1","Sorry not impressed with this one at all. Tasted like shortbread cookies to us."
"2","5","Used this recipe for mini cupcakes. I doubled the milk and baked for 10 mins at 350F. The recipe made over 40 mini cupcakes. Unbelievably fluffy, light and not too sweet. Will make again!"
"2","5","Love this recipe, very easy and tasty!"
"2","4","Nice basic recipe. It tastes like the cookies I make for Christmas. I think I will keep looking I want something more moist and that tastes different. You could always put a pudding mix or apple sauce in it to make it moist."
"2","5","Wonderful, simple cake. Tastes old-fashioned and is particularly good with the 'best buttercream frosting' also on this site. I would recommend the high altitude adjustments suggested on this site (less baking powder, higher temp) for others who live in areas over 5,000 ft, though!"
"2","5","This cake was so good!! Taste is similar to pound cake with a lighter texture. I added 1/4 tsp. almond extract in addition to the vanilla. As the other reviews suggested, mix each ingredient in thoroughly. It was devoured by all!!"
"2","3","I really wanted something special when I was making this cake, and I really wasn't disappointed. I beat the mix a lot, and added chocolate chips and a teaspoon of hunny, less a teaspoon of vanilla and it was beautiful. Thanks!"
"2","4","Very yummy cake! Mine was a little bit dry though so will try using different pans next time and watching it a bit more closely."
"2","3","I'm sorry but I didn't really care for this recipe. I am an experienced baker and i just don't like the texture of these."
"2","3","I was not very impressed by this cake. It definitely is not sweet, it is very dry also. I followed the recipe exactly."
"2","4","This was good but not as moist as I would have liked it. My husband and son thought it was good, also. It didn't last long!"
"2","5","This cake was really easy to make and turned out great. Thicker than I'm used to, but it's a nice variety from the norm. Will definately be using this recipe again!"
"2","5","my family loved it! my little brother ate 4 cupcakes. he could have ate more but my mum made him stop. haha. so everyone loved it"
"2","5","delicious.... the perfect white cake recipe. yet simple and versitle... I made cupcake using this recipe for a dinner party and well who doesn't like cupcakes...matched them with rick's special buttercream icing from this site and they were a hit. use this super fast recipe and u will never by boxed cake ever. I dont believe in the boxed cake so this was a wonderful recipe. Turned out light and fluffy. I used a hand mixer and creamed the butter and sugar well.. that gives it the fluffyness.. the less u beat it the more dense it will turn out. so mixing makes a differance. made 12 big cupcakes. next time i'm making them mini cupcakes... thanx for the recipe.. luvved it."
"2","5","Very good recipe. Simple to make when I had little in the house to make a cake with ...would recommend it"
"2","5","YUM! i made a dozen perfect cupcakes! great recipe! i only had self rising flour so i didnt use any baking soda....still came out great. perfect browning, perfect light cakes, moist. if you have a dense cake, you probably over mixed your batter...just mix it until combined and walk away! i will use this recipe forever!"
"2","5","A very tasty, dense cake that would be appropriate for birthday cake or wedding cake. Very yummy and moist. I made it in three eight-inch round cake pans, baked, cooled, wrapped and froze each layer individually the night before the party. Next morning I took them out of the freezer and the frozen layers made assembly and frosting a breeze. I paired this recipe with one called 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' on this site, and it was a good pairing. Frosted while frozen, it thawed beautifully without affecting the consistency/appearance of the frosting, and was indistinguishable from freshly-made cake. Delicious paired with vanilla ice cream, too! Will definitely make again!"
"2","5","This is an excellent cake. We all love it and it is perfect for making wedding cakes."
"2","4","Cupcake makers beware!! This recipe a) expands a LOT, and b) makes far more than 12 cupcakes per batch, at least for medium-small muffin pans..."
"2","5","Awesome! I made these as cupcakes and I doctored it a bit (I always doctor everything), and used 1.5 tsp of vanilla, and 1.5 tsp of rum, and chocolate chips. It gave it a nice depth of flavor. I didn't even need icing at all. Next time I want to try adding coconut, too. This recipe is so flexible, you can do a lot to it. Thank you!"
"2","5","I make these cupcakes almost every week for my family. They're sooooo delicious, we can't get enough! They don't even need icing! Sometimes I substitute vanilla with coconut extract. Either way, you have to try this. So easy and so amazingly good. Thank you!"
"2","5","this is a great recipe i am not an accomplished chef and had a very dificult time baking on most occations but this recipe was simple and delitious a rave review from my family they were definately enjoyed"
"2","5","mmmmm... i had been craving cup cakes for days! i finally made them with this recipe. sooooo goood!!! i melted some ghiradelli (did i spell that right?) chocolate chips with a splash of milk and iced the cup cakes with yummy chocolate. gah! so delicious!"
"2","5","I went searching for a quick and easy cake recipe after having a sweet tooth attack. The recipe is great if you want something sweet and simple to make. I actually made this with margarine and reconstituted powdered milk (don't judge, I just hadn't been to the store for a while :D). Also, I ended up sprinkling some white sugar on the top during the last couple of baking minutes. Delish!"
"2","5","I love this recipe! It is really quite easy. I took other suggestions and I do not skip beating the butter and sugar for 8 minutes, as well I beat each additional step very well. I make it as a pineapple upside down cake, so instead of adding extra milk I add 1/4 - 1/2 C pineapple juice from the pineapples and it is SOOO YUMMM! Very soft and sweet and moist. Also $0 minutes does not seem to be enough. So as another suggestion I read I turn my oven down to 250 and bake an additional almost 20 minutes."
"2","5","I doubled it and threw it into a bundt pan and made a minneola glaze. The cake was tender and moist. I made sure to beat in each egg carefully. Yummy!"
"2","5","This was nice and creamy as batter and tasty done.I used a pretty pink icing for my sisters 5,6 and I used buttercream for me and my dad.This'll be another keeper."
"2","5","I made this recipe once and it turned out great. Then I tried a few others just to get a feel for scratch cake baking and I have come right back to this recipe!!! It works out perfectly every single time, it's completely fool proof in my opinion. I have made these into 8' round cakes and cupcakes, and they are moist, light and just delicious. I will hang on to this one for good."
"2","5","Added extra 1/4 cup of milk, as suggested. Made mini-cupcakes. Used about 1 T of batter per cupcake, and baked for 12 minutes. Wonderful!"
"2","4","Looooove it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a yellow cake (because of the egg yolks), and I used about 1 cup of buttermilk instead of 1/2 regular milk. I am not sure how the cake would of came if I had followed the recipe to a tee, but I also can't see why anyone would have a problem with this cake. It is just what it is titled 'Simple White Cake' I love the texture and how moist it is. I made this cake with Fondant and butter cream frosting, and filled it homemade strawberry cream cheese filling. It was great. Thanks for sharing the recipe"
"2","4","I would give it 4 1/2 if I could. I made this cause I wanted a white cake for my daughter's birthday. I did a trail cake first, with splenda, followed the instructions as written, though I added a 1/4 cup more milk. It turned out quite nice. SO then I made it again, as I did the first time, this time with sugar. FYI, the texture and taste were the same using Splenda. The downside, my daughter got at the cake before it got a chance to be frosted. We ate the remains. I decided there was no way I was making a cake, again, so I made cupcakes instead, only this time I used canola oil instead of butter, and I added a 1/4 cup marachino cherry juice and added cut up marachino cherries to the mix. Then, sincerely, the power went out! HA! It was out for FOUR hours! I was sure the cupcakes wouldn't turn out. But I covered them up anyway with plastic wrap to protect the batter. When the power returned I cooked them up! Well, I am happy to report they cooked up just wonderfully. Canola oil can be used instead quite sucessfully, but the batter itself won't be as ... fluffy (make sure you beat the heck out of this batter - it needs it). I personally prefer this recipe as cupcakes. I won't make the cake again. To crumbly, like cornbread. The cake is nice, moist, filling, heavy. If you want fluffy and light, like a boxed cake, my suggestion is to make a boxed cake. lol"
"2","4","Great basic white cake recipe. I served it with sliced strawberries."
"2","5","I have made this cake a few times now and it is wonderful, I didn't have to change/add anything. I came out great every time."
"2","4","The first time I made this recipe, I doubled the recipe, since I was making a layer cake, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was simple, but it was not perfect. Despite greasing and flouring the pans, it stuck horribly. The finished cake was a bit dry and a bit too sweet. I've based my rating on that prep. The second time I made it, I substituted 1/2 cup canola oil for 1/2 cup of the butter (remember, I'm making layer cakes, here, so I'm doubling the recipe), and I reduced the sugar to 1 2/3 cups. It was a lot better the second time."
"2","5","This was the bottom layer of my three tiered wedding cake. It was sooooo good. seriously really easy to make and seriously delicious. I grew up not liking cake at all but this has made me change my mind. It was the perfect density."
"2","4","Very easy to make. Excellent instructions. Delicious! I had to make a cake in a hurry and jumped online to quickly find a recipe. The ingredients are pretty basic, so I had everything I needed... and 45 minutes later we were sitting around eating birthday cake. Normally with such short notice I would have just stopped by the grocery store to pick one up, but that wasn't an option this time... and the best thing was that everyone seemed to enjoy this cake so much more than store bought."
"2","2","Followed the recipe exactly and was pretty disappointed. The texture was that of a corn muffin, and the flavor just wasn't all that great to me. My mate was put off by the texture/look. Sadly, I think this is one recipe that won't be revisited."
"2","5","I found this recipe here a few years ago, and since the first time I made it, it's been my standard white cake recipe. It's the best!"
"2","3","Well, this was a very simple cake to make. I do give it that. However, the taste was something to be desired. It reminded me a lot of cornbread. It was good for a simple cake but if you are trying to make a cake for impressive purposes, not the recipe to go with."
"2","5","I followed the recipe exactly, and it made two nine inch layers. I reccomend mixing everything very well for a long time. It worked really well for a poke cake. Thx!"
"2","5","i simply loved this cake! I am a lacto-vegetarian, meaning I do not eat meat or eggs, but I do eat other dairy. I love to bake, but seeing as I cannot use eggs, I usually use and egg-substitue; 1 Tbs. Corn Flour mixed with 2 Tbs. oil, instead. It works well for everything but cakes. Before I used egg-free recipes all my cakes used to crumble during transfer. So now I try to search for egg-free recipes. My sister's birthday was last week and I was searching for the perfect cake recipe. She only like plain, white, vanilla cake, so I was desperately searching for an egg free one. However I could not find it. The night before I settled for this recipe, very anxious and worried that it would crumble like in the past. Still, it sounded good and the reviews i read seemed helpful, so i made it. I was AMAZING! I was so happy about how it came out. I followed the amount given in the recipe and it made one 10' cake pan. I decided to make a second layer afterwards. It was so fast and simple to make. I only had 3 hours to make the whole cake, ice it, and decorate it before my sister came home. I had more than enough time because this cake was SOOO simple! I enjoyed making this cake more than any other cake I have made before! After letting it cool, I frosted it with some of Rick's Special Buttercream frosting, another recipe from this site, and decorating with candy (because my sister LOVES CANDY). Just a tip: If you plan to use Rick's Special Buttercream frosting, I would tone down the s"
"2","4","This was a nice recipe, I made cupcakes. I used 1/2 cup veg oil instead of butter, and 1 cup of milk. They were still alittle dry, I might add even more milk next time. They were alittle dense. I will keep this recipe."
"2","1","I followed the recipe and although it was simple, it was also tasteless. Waste of ingredients."
"2","4","It sure is simple! Simple enough."
"2","4","This tasted really good. I made them as cupcakes and had a cream cheese icing with it and they were great. My only complaint is that the cake was a little too moist. They really fell apart easily, but other then that it was good."
"2","4","Very nice flavor. Needed to add double the amount of milk to achieve the right consistancy of your typical cake mix. Easy to frost. No need for boxed cake any more with this recipe!"
"2","5","BRILLIANT!!!!...its so easy to make....even my 12 yr olds can do it..... Have made it twice .. Both times came out brilliantly... Added 3/4 cup walnuts to the mixture to add a nutty flavour .....They tasted heavenly.....Just follow the instructions carefully and u will do wonderfully.....Its simplicity is what i like the best ..i just had to work fr 10 minutes or so.... and i got a incredibly soft , fragrant cake......YUMM!!!!......baked slowly at 150 Degrees C for 20 minutes and then covered for 20 minutes at 250 degrees...."
"2","5","Thanks to other reviewers, I beat this recipe 10 minutes every phase. I substituted one cup of coconut milk for the 'milk' ingredient and used 1/2 cup of sugar in the raw and 1/2 cup white sugar.   In the future, I'll probably leave out the white sugar as the sweetness of the coconut milk should suffice. But it was perfect. And I do not even like cake!!!  This cake was extrememly moist and HEAVY. Made six of the best bunny shaped cupcakes. With the left over batter, I filled two custard cups with cupcake liners and oiled the lip of the cup. Then my 2 year old dropped white and chocolate chips onto the top. This was amazing! We devoured the tops!  I did alter the recipe a bit because some people said it was dry and this that and the other. I do not know how you could get bad results as long as you follow the directions and beat it well. I used a ladel to fill the bunny pan and it barely poured out on its own. It was THAT thick and silky.  I love this recipe. Once mastered, you can make variations."
"2","5","A great basic cake! I was out of vanilla extract, but they still came out great. Like others, I added a little extra milk. I topped with a strawberry frosting. I think this will be my go-to white cake from now on. Thanks!"
"2","5","This is one of the best homemade cakes I've ever had.   My daughter was hungry for cupcakes and I didn't have a mix. She found this recipe and made her cupcakes; I was very surprised at how good they were.   She made them exactly as the recipe is written except she creamed the butter and the sugar for about 8 to 10 minutes on our Kitchen Aid mixer. Under creaming is usually the reason people don't get a good result from a homemade cake."
"2","4","I made cupcakes with this. they came out moist but I would have liked them 'fluffier'. I did add more milk. I will try it again though. I like the fact that there is no shortening used."
"2","5","This is a lovely cake and I will make it again. This little cake is the perfect 'dinette' size. The only change I made was to increase the milk to 2/3 cup for a little extra moistness."
"2","5","This is the best cupcake recipe I have ever made. I followed it as written and cakes were moist and fluffy and had great flavor. My cupcakes will never come from a box again. YUM!"
"2","4","I made this recipe two years in a row for Christmas now, though I forgot to review it last year.. and all in all it is a good cake, though I did find that it was a little dry... aside from that, it was easy to make, and tasted just like the cakes my Grandparents used to make."
"2","4","They were truly delicious, but did have a very cornbready taste. I added a little more vanilla extract, butter and milk to make it sweeter. My batter didn't taste very good but once they baked they were good!"
"2","3","Kind of disappointed me a little bit. It was decieving because it looked absolutely amazing, but after I frosted it and served it at Thanksgiving for 3 family members' b-days, I noticed people only eating half their slice because it was so dry. I added more milk like many reviewers suggested, but I guess it didn't help much. Will continue searching for a good white cake recipe."
"2","4","This recipe is wonderful, although the batter was a little thick. I added another 1/2 cup of milk, and I think it did the job because my cupcakes turned out very nicely. Also, the recipe seems to make a little more than 12 cupcakes, as it says, I filled all my cupcake cups 3/4 up, and had enough batter left for 4 more."
"2","4","I made this recipe as cupcakes. Very yummy, but like the other members said, the texture is dense. I would have liked a more fluffy texture but it was still good. I altered the recipe a bit by increasing the amount of milk as others have suggested. I put in about 3/4 cups. I did not adjust the vanilla amount, it was just right. Good recipe but still looking for a better one for cupcakes."
"2","5","Simple, easy, and delish!!!!! What more could you ask for."
"2","1","Awful. I followed the recipe exactly, and my cake turned out hard. What the heck happened?! Today is my best friend's birthday and she'll be here in a couple hours. Now I have to attempt to make a whole new cake before she arrives."
"2","4","After reading some of the mixed reviews, I thought I'd better try it out for myself and it wasn't bad. I understand why some described a 'cornmeal' texture but it still had a fluffiness to it along with a pretty good flavor. Taking the advise from some of the other reviewers I used a full tablespoon of vanilla and the extra milk, however I don't recommend the extra teaspoon of vanilla because for me it was just a little too much (but still edible!). I would say try the recipe as is, beat the butter and sugar thoroughly to incorporate air (in order to make it fluffy), and monitor it closely in the oven. Overall, not bad. My family devoured it!"
"2","5","Easy to make and it tastes brilliant especially with the banana butter icing. I made it in a 9x13 tray."
"2","5","one thing and one thing only me and the mrs have noticed about this recipe. 1/2 a teaspoon of salt goes a long way in this cake. just a touch. other then that, simply by far one of the best cakes we have ever had the pleasure of making."
"2","5","I used this recipe and won SECOND PIRZE at the county fair."
"2","4","Easy and tastes great!"
"2","5","This is the one. I made a simple addition to give it that Bakery Birthday Cake taste. Just add 1/2 box of (instant or other) pudding mix. Voila pure perfection."
"2","5","I made this cake 3 weeks ago and looked and looked until I found it again. It was THAT good. BIG HIT WITH THE KIDS"
"2","4","Delicious! This deserves 4 and a half stars. After reading numerous reviews, I decided to add 1/8 cup more milk and my cupcakes came out very fluffy and tasty. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
"2","4","On my hunt for a good yellow/white cake recipe for cupcakes, this has turned out the best so far. I didn't have a density problem like some. Mine were fluffy and light. I found it was a tad crumbly so maybe I'll add an egg white to bind it together next time.   To make sure I avoided a dense cake, I creamed the butter well, added the sugar and beat it until it was very light and fluffy. I then added the yolk. I alternated mixing in the wet and dry ingredients. I whipped the egg whites to medium peaks and folded them in at the end.   I will make this again and hopefully adding the egg white will keep the cake together a little bit more."
"2","5","OMG this recipe just saved me! My husband's birthday is tomorrow, and I don't have any money for a cake mix...and it's 10pm. His birthday is tomorrow. I do have frosting, so I get online and search, find this recipe, by the way I am not a great cook in anyway or baker haha, I try tho. I happen to have all these ingredients so I went for it. They are perfect. Taste better than a mix. I'm sold. THANK YOU SO MUCH! :) My daughter, who's 5 helped too. Real easy and delish!"
"2","5","Wow! This were great just out of the oven - it had a nice crispy top, moist (definitely take the suggestion of 1 cup of milk for cupcakes) and easy to make!"
"2","5","This recipe is awesome for making cupcakes. I made it with my friend, and she ate at least 3 of them. :D"
"2","3","This cake was all right, it wasn't awful. But I feel that there's a better recipe out there. The texture it produced was odd. It wasn't 'dry,' but the crumb was small and grainy. And it wasn't fluffy."
"2","4","The only problem I had was it did not caution about High Altitude. Dang ... it bubbled all over my oven. the cake looked more like a pie. We ate it anyhow! :)"
"2","5","very good used 3\4c. milk instead of  1\2 cup will make again"
"2","5","THIS RECIPE WAS REALLY GOOOD.I REDUCED THE MILK LIKE OTHER REVIEWS RECOMMENDED AND I REDUCED THE SUGAR TO MAKE THEM A LIL LESS SWEETER.THEY WERE REALLY EASY TO MAKE AND IM 14 SO YOU KNOW YOU DNT HAVE TO BE A TOP CHEF!!! AND THEY WERE A HIT"
"2","4","These were pretty good but I am glad that I followed the other reviewers recommendations and added extra milk and vanilla. I made marble cupcakes and they really turned out fluffy and yummy. I am giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to change the ingredients and it didn´t turn out white but more yellow."
"2","3","a very simple recipe, but mine did not come out right. I am a baking and pastry student in culinary school so I'm sure I did all the steps right, but the batter was SO thick! I went back to look at allrecipes.com to see if there was anything on the recipe indicating it would be so thick. No luck, so I added about 1/2 a cup of milk but next time I might add more. And although I greased the pan with Pam as usual, and the cake itself had a good amount of grease to it (not too much, not too little), I could NOT get it out of the pan! totally ruined the birthday cake I needed for the next day. I was also using a new pan which might be the problem. Also, you might want to double the batter if you want to make a bigger or 4 inch tall cake. This barely made one 8 1/2 inch round cake, that was barely 2 inches high. Still, gotta love a simple recipe!"
"2","3","As far as taste goes, this recipe deserves four stars. However, it would be more appropriate to say Simple Yellow Cake than Simple White. I love the taste, but it is definitely not a white cake."
"2","5","I needed to make 130 cupcakes for my children's school. I used this recipe before for a birthday cake and got rave reviews, so I used it this time and once again, nothing but raves. I bake at least three times a week, but rarely use the same recipe more then twice, but I think I will keep this one."
"2","5","Very quick & easy recipe. I've been looking for a good white cake recipe for a while now. Finally I found one. Only one problem; I followed the recipe to a T & it wasn't enough. Needs to be doubled. Thank you."
"2","4","Like many white cakes, this cake is dense but it is quite good. I did sift the flour, beat the sugar & butter until quite light, and added a tiny bit more (an ounce) milk. Everyone enjoyed it and my husband asked for it for his birthday next month. This recipe is definetly a keeper!"
"2","5","Very moist and fluffy, with a delicious vanilla flavour. I will definitely use this recipe again!"
"2","5","Perfect! Thumbs up here!"
"2","5","Super simple and delicious. I had to use almond extract b/c I was out of vanillla, but all the same, the cake turned out delicious!"
"2","5","What a great & easy recipe!!! I made it for 36 servings & found the taste to be tremendous & the consistency perfect. THANK YOU!!!"
"2","2","Well, the batter tasted good.... however, the 'cupcakes' turned out very dense and cornbread-like. I followed the recipe exactly and I don't recommend it to anyone (unless you're looking for a vanilla cornbread recipe). Maybe cutting the flour in about half and adding some more milk could fix this, but I'm just going to look elsewhere."
"2","5","I thought this cake was fine considering the reviews it got. I added a cup of sweetened coconut flakes and it was awesome!!!!"
"2","5","Wow! My first time making a white cake from scratch. And let me tell ya, it was FANTASTIC! However, next time I will most likely double the recipe for a nice two layer cake. Great recipe, Scott! Thanks."
"2","4","I love this recipe! My boyfriend and I were in a cake-craving mode, and when I found this recipe, I was glad I had all the ingredients on hand! We both like desserts that aren't too sweet (i.e. processed cake-out-of-a-box), so this recipe was wonderful. One note: after mixing all the ingredients as instructed, I added ca. 1/8 c. more milk. The cake turned out moist!"
"2","5","This recipe is very delicious and easy. I added a little bit of ground cinnamon and it tastes great! Make sure you wash it down with some milk!"
"2","5","Happy New Year! I felt like cake for New Year's Eve and decided to try this recipe because I didn't have a lot of ingredients onhand. I was pleasantly that such a simple recipe could make a very tasty cake. Not too sweet/not too fancy/very easy to make...perfect for my craving. Mine turned out very buttery! I think too many of us are used to processed foods so a cake like this may be not for them. As for myself, I'm getting back to the basics so it's wonderful for me! :) Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","1","Against all the negative reviews for this recipe I tried it anyway. This is not the recipe to use when replacing a box cake mix. This is the kind mom and grandma made from scratch. Heavy and thick - will not crumble and does NOT soften when topped with pineapple and coolwhip. Flavor is very good for a BRICK."
"2","5","Realy fun, and the addition of food colouring can make this great for any childs party."
"2","5","This a great, simple mixture! The cupcakes turned out absolutely PERFECT when made with butter (very light and moist). However, when we tried it with margarine, the cupcakes were a little hard and not nearly as fluffy. Bake with butter and you can't go wrong!"
"2","4","I made this recipe as cupcakes and added colored sprinkles to the batter to give it a confetti appearance. I made chocolate frosting to go on top. It was a lovely thick, moist, cupcake. Two of my children liked them and one did not."
"2","5","The best cupcakes we ever had!"
"2","5","This is a very easy and fast simple cake to make. You can opt. to not add any vanilla extracts and it would still taste fine. Remember not to put inside the refridgerator since it would take away the nice egg/cake smell and taste."
"2","3","It is easy to make and I enjoyed, but my food critics at home didn't enjoy it as much as I did."
"2","4","I needed this in a pinch and it came through for me. It was quick and tasty. I poured hot fudge sauce over the top and even my child gobbled it up. However, it is more yellow than white."
"1","5","At first I thought this was going to turn out great, but when my friend finished icing it I knew that this was all wrong. I knew exactly what I had to do. Despite my friend's disapproving stare, I angled my fist and landed a solid punch into the cake. My fist barely made a dent in the cake even after compulsively slamming my fist into the cake. 'Caroline!' My friend Sharon had yelled, 'You're such a wildcard!' After that we enjoyed a happy fun-filled night to remember. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"1","4","I doubled this recipe and it came out well. Since I wanted the cake to be nice and white I only used the egg whites and discarded the yolks. Divided the batter into three parts and added food color to two of the parts thus making red, white and blue for July 4th. Used half butter and half shortening to insure moistness. It made 18 lrg cupcakes. I found this cake to be dense and more muffin texture than I would like. This probably wouldn't be the case if I had used cake flour. Not too sweet. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. These were great."
"1","5","I use this recipe 2-3 times a week. I love the denseness of it when I use all-purpose flour. I have gotten so comfortable with the recipe I have added bananas (which wasn't a big hit), lemon (which was) and 1/4 cup cocoa for a chocolate version. It made the cake a bit drier and the chocolate flavor was very subtle which we liked. I hardly ever use frosting on this cake...I just sprinkle on some powered sugar. I also increased the milk to 3/4 cup. I use raw sugar and King Arthur flour....I haven't had any problems making the recipe...I know some people suggest having your eggs and butter at room but I just beat the heck out of it and have never had a problem.....I will use this recipe forever and I cant wait to try it with other flavors...I think maple syrup will be our next adventure"
"1","2","The cupcakes were dry & tasted more like a pound cake."
"1","5","A friend recommended this to me and wow, what a fantastic cake recipe. All flavors are perfectly balanced and it's incredibly easy to make. I made cupcakes and they came out with perfect texture in and out. I really like the fineness of the crumb, but that could be because I really whipped up the butter, sugar and egg mixture with a wire whip beater, then switched to a paddle-type beater for mixing in the remaining dry ingredients."
"1","5","This recipe turned out great. We made a triple batch and turned it into 36 cupcakes. It had great texture and flavor. A very good Vessel for just about any type of frosting or design you might want to try."
"1","5","I use this recipe to make cupcakes. They are super delicious!"
"1","5","Very soft and delicate texture! Loved it and the family loved it as well. Moist and flavorful."
"1","5","Hum Hum yummy good."
"1","5","love the cake it is delicious"
"1","3","It was okay. I found it to be a bit too eggy but maybe it's because I barely eat eggs EVER! I truly tasted the egg flavor and it made it a bit hard to eat. My daughter loved it...but then again, she's 4 and loves anything sweet! Aside from the egg flavor, the cake was beautiful and just moist enough. I think next time, I'll use one egg or an egg substitute because I do believe this cake was one ingredient shy of being PERFECT!"
"1","5","Excellent. Whipped batter a lot at all stages, left ingredients exactly as written. Finished off with buttercream icing- delicious! Will probably double recipe and try cupcakes next time."
"1","4","It was a good recipe but I found the batter to be quite thick. Like other popular cake recipes, to make the cake super moist, I added a cup of boiling water as well as a tsp of almond extract to enhance the flavour. Fabulous!"
"1","5","I have tried this recipe multiple times and it always turns out amazing!! I would recommend this to everyone."
"1","4","This is a great simple recipe that is a wonderful base for other flavors (chocolate, strawberry, caramel, etc.) I ran short on butter once, so I used half butter and half olive oil I mixed the oil in after the rest of the recipe was mixed together. It was really good!"
"1","5","Very good, simple recipe. I have made it a few different times and tonight i switched the vanilla extract to coconut extract with a cherry frosting,, yummy.. This is going to be my go to basic cake.."
"1","5","This recipe was amazing. Totally loved it. I had so much fun baking this cake! My family loved it."
"1","5","I have used this recipe twice already and it was a success with family and friends! It was quick and easy, no hunting around supermarkets for ingredients; the basic ingredients are all ready in the kitchen! I added fruit toppings or just served it plain, its that good!"
"1","4","It is as the name suggests,simple. Its also very easy to do. A boxed cake mix is quicker but this is definitely a recipe worth saving! Thanks for the suggestion to use this to make cupcakes. This will be my go-to recipe from now on."
"1","5","DELICIOUS! tastes amazng and super easy to make. i followed exactly as stated an added confectioners sugar (powered sugar) and drizzled condensed milk on top. my husband and i had it right out of the oven and went back for seconds. Will definitely make this recipe again."
"1","5","Used this recipe to make a honeybun cake from this website. So moist and delish."
"1","5","Fabulous and super quick! I substituted white sugar with Turbinado (brown) with a 1:1 ratio. The cake was fabulous and moist. Perfect for any occasion and also for a weekday craving!"
"1","5","I added 2 packs of swiss miss milk Chocolate hot cocoa mix, then baked it in a bundt cake pan."
"1","4","I love this recipe so much. It's moist and just so delicious!!! I have made it 2 times in this week and I recommend it.  Great for cupcakes!"
"1","4","I made this recipe today. However, I did use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. This was the first time I had made a cake from scratch. This recipe was a great way to practice making and decorating a cake for my cake decorating class next fall! Not to mention how good it tastes!"
"1","5","Amazing results !! The third time I added dates and walnuts even yummier improvisation."
"1","1","Read the comments before you make this cake. The directions leave a lot of things out."
"1","5","I have made the cake recipe into cupcakes many times over the years and its a phenomenal recipe. This year for one of my best friend's birthdays I made a pinata cake using this recipe. The results were the best! The food coloring worked beautifully and the cake held together and tasted amaing."
"1","5","This cake is super easy and comes out perfectly as long as you follow the mixing directions. I like to add bananas before the vanilla step and it makes a delicous banana cake! One banana or two depending on your taste"
"1","1","Yuck, this turned out dry and nasty. My kids wouldnt even eat it. I had to throw away the rest of it."
"1","3","I made it exactly how the instructions said to. It was okay. Not like a regular cake though. Its in between cake and cornbread. It taste okay."
"1","5","SIMPLE AND DELICIOUS!! I dont bake cakes merely because the first time i did i was so dissappointed at the results but then i found this recipe and it turned out to be amazing . I did add some raisins at the top and a little orange zest in the batter and the family loved it. I sure will make it again."
"1","5","I tried this recipe today. I like vanilla but not a big fan of it. So i put just a teaspoon. Also after reading couple comments,i put little extra milk as suggested. And the result was amazing! Taste was just right and cake was very soft and so delicious! My family loved it. Thanks for sharing ^^"
"1","5","I've made this cake twice now. It's very rare to find anything that all 4 of my kids like, but they all love this cake! I made it today and it came out so moist and delicious (no dry crumbly cake here!). I doubled the recipe to use a 10 x 14 pan. As other reviewers suggested, I added extra 1/2 tsp salt (or 1 tsp doubled) and 1/4 cup milk (1/2 cup doubled). I also sprinkled in a bit of cinnamon and used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup raw honey instead of all sugar. I put the butter (used Earth Balance sticks) in with sugar in stand mixer and let it mix for 5 min. Then added eggs one at a time, vanilla and honey, and mixed them together well. Then I alternated adding flour/baking powder mix and milk (used unsweetened almond milk). It really did come out amazing! I highly recommend trying the raw honey. Will definitely be making this one again!"
"1","4","It's dense and not super flavorful but okay . Will add to next time...."
"1","5","Did this cake for 100 people for my daughter s first birthday! Amazing moist fragrant and tasty! Added some salt though to balance the sweetness and creamed the sugar and the butter for 40 minutes! !! Super easy..."
"1","5","Love it!!!! Cooked it for the family they went crazy over it. Try it with a homemade caramel sauce it is so wonderful."
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for well over a year now, and can NOT believe it only has 4 stars! Its an easy, simple cake to make and tastes better than any white cake I've ever had before. Yes- definitely like a sugar cookie turned cake, for sure. Great stuff. I use it in the summertime and top it with fresh berries and whipped cream."
"1","5","Best White Cake I've found!"
"1","5","I made this cake after reading a lot of the ratings. I beat the sugar and butter for at least 8 minutes and used 1tbsp of vanilla extract. Came out great. The cake was gone in half an hour. Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","Delicious and easy! Thanks"
"1","2","I read a good amount of the reviews on this cake, so I was pretty sure the end result would be one of two things. It was either going to taste like a sugar cookie or cornbread. I was hoping for sugar cookie, but I got cornbread, even though the cake smelled like a sugar cooke! I don't get it. My husband thought it tasted like a pancake. Regardless, I won't be making this cake again."
"1","4","This cake was really good! The taste was perfect and the texture was amazing. I made it for my sisters birthday, and all she did was complain that 'it's not moist', but that just means more for me! I think it was really moist and was eaten up really quick. Her loss, I guess."
"1","5","I baked this cake with my grandchildren. They hated it. But it's all good yo. I liked it. The cake reminded me of myself. In my younger years that is. All fresh and new, but somewhat fragile. MmmmmMMMmmmmMmMMMmMMM."
"1","5","My friend doesn't even line cake made the cupcakes he tore them up"
"1","2","This recipe was very pretty and it had amazing texture! BUT ITS REALLY BLAND!"
"1","1","It was very dry and hard."
"1","2","It was way too dry for my liking. Had a tiny piece and i felt like i needed a large glass of milk."
"1","5","I am baking this cake with some pretty great girls for our friend who is leaving for India in the morning. We haven't even finished making the cake and its already going swimmingly, thank you for posting this fun and simple recipe! Highly recommend."
"1","5","Okay, good. I need a cake recipe that can be anything with a few ingredients added to it-chocolate, vanilla, spicy, fruity, whatever, and I think this just might be it. Good to memorize, too!"
"1","1","I hate to do this but I have to: this is the worst tasting cake recipe I have ever made! Absolutely no flavor."
"1","4","I used this recipe after a different recipe failed. I liked it, and paired it with White Cake Frosting II on here. No adjustments."
"1","5","Love this simple vanilla cake! Followed others advice and added extra milk."
"1","2","It was really simple to make. Followed the recipe exactly as it is written and it tastes like pancake. Its not a bad taste but not good for a dessert. I might have it in the morning for breakfast."
"1","4","Made cupcakes and they tasted just like sugar cookies"
"1","5","This was excellent. I set the butter out and put the inside of two vanilla beans in 3/4 cup milk. I put the milk-bean mixture in the fridge started mixing the cake when butter was room temperature. As others suggested I mixed thoroughly between each step. It came out perfectly."
"1","3","I made this cake twice last night, and both times a double batch for size purposes. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it came out sort of hard. The second time I added a bit of baking soda and reduced the cook time and it came out soft but firm which is what I was looking for."
"1","4","I used this recipe (exact) to make a batch of cupcakes. The texture of the cake was perfect for the type of cupcakes I was making. When the cupcakes first cooled my first thoughts were they were a little dense and dry. After icing them I decided to refrigerate (due to whipped cream icing). I must say after being chilled a little bit they were very moist and fluffy! Another one of my concerns was there was no salt so I thought the cupcakes may come out too sweet, but it actually wasn't. Also, I only had 2% milk on hand, but I would prefer to use whole. Overall I did like the recipe, but may make some adjustments if I use it again."
"1","5","this is the best vanila cake i ever had"
"1","4","This was my first time actually making this cake. The cake finished baking before the time was up. The cake was sort of bouncy, similar to a sponge. The batter was good, and especially the few crumbs that stuck to the pan. This recipe made two cakes in round pans. It was sweet and not bad. Out of being dry and moist I'd say it was in between. It was moist but not too moist and not too dry. Like Jillian I should've added ice cream. The icing I chose was ok with it but it was my first time making it too. The cake plus the icing I had was on the sweet side. This cake would've seemed nice with the Jif hazelnut moca cappuccino in it to have another flavor. I think I would make this again but with a different flavor."
"1","5","I tried it took the other reviews and added the extra milk and the cake came out great. It was light and fluffy I used almond extract it was great"
"1","5","I don't understand the negative comments. This recipe is very easy and makes a very moist, fluffy and tasty white cake. At the last minute, I decided to add some chocolate to the batter. It just came out of the oven and I already ate a couple of generous slices. You can serve with fruit, ice cream. I didn't even worry about frosting it. No need. I will be making this again! (Unfortunately I can't post a nice picture of it. Allrecipes doesn't let me to... too much resizing and nothing works) Oh well. There goes the review, at least."
"1","5","I put the extra 1/4 cup of milk and used country crock instead of butter because it happened to be in my fridge. It was delicious. I am not an avid baker but I am picky. It was light and fluffy and tasty. I had company It is almost all gone. I put orange frosting on it with dried cranberries and strawberries. It was totally awesome. Iwas impressed with how delicious it was due to thereviews about it being heavy and tasteless"
"1","3","Very crumbly"
"1","5","Love it so easy and tasty. I used whole wheat flour and it was fantastic!"
"1","1","Terrible. .....no flavor and like cornbread"
"1","5","I have made this cake for my son birthday and turned out delicious (did not change or add anything different from the recipe).The cupcakes I did add a bit more of milk 3/4 in total made it very fluffy and moist! For you, that is tempted to try this recipe...it's worth it! Measured all your ingredients and it will turn it right!"
"1","4","This was a very good recipe, and very easy (save for some brutal mixing!) I didn't have many of the issues some of the other people had. My cupcakes were moist, and tall!  I followed the recipe, save for adding 1/4c milk, and 2tsp vanilla extra. I also used bread flour (which probably helped the cake to rise more than the others). While mixing, i folded the batter into it's self and tried to make it as fluffy as possible, which i think helped to achieve the perfect texture mine had!  The only reason i give this recipe 4 stars, instead of 5 is because the cake is lacking in flavor. I'll try adding orange or lemon zest next time."
"1","5","This cake was excellent. I followed it exactly with the exception of adding slightly more milk (as suggested by others) and some chocolate chips (I'm a chocolate addict). I had no issues with it crumbling or resembling corn bread. I think the main thing as many have stated is you MUST WHIP THE BUTTER, SUGAR THEN EGGS UNTIL IT IS CREAMY. That appears to be key and worked like a charm. This will be my go-to vanilla cake. I topped it off with whipped cream and strawberries. Yum!"
"1","4","Quick and easy recipe, my family loved it! I felt the texture wasn't quite right. Next time I will use bread flour."
"1","5","This cake is simple and delicious! I will never use a box mix white cake again!!!!"
"1","1","The cake wasn't light and fluffy. It was heavy."
"1","5","This is an Amazing cupcake recipe! I was teaching my daughter and her friend ( 9 and 8 year olds) how to bake. Wow what a reward for a learning experience. This is a family keeper! Can't wait to make it in cake form!"
"1","5","The best cake recipe on this planet. A firm moist cake that appeals to everyone. So easy to make. I used coconut milk instead of milk and it turned out great. Frosted with fluffy butter cream that I tinted bubble gum pink. I will be making this cake often. A sure fire winner. Try and you will love it. Yummy nummy! :)"
"1","5","Loved this cake! I also increased the milk to 3/4 cup as others had recommended. I used only 1 tsp of vanilla (personal preference), and those were the only changes. We beat it well in between each step, (and that was only with a hand mixer). It was perfect.  Thank you!"
"1","5","This is my go-to white cake recipe, but I have to admit it took me a few tries to perfect it. The directions are vague. You really need to cream the butter and sugar. I leave mine for about five minutes in my stand mixer. Then beat the eggs in one at a time and mix really well after each addition and scrape the bowl between eggs. I add 1/4 extra of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla. You want your batter to be thick and fluffy when you are finished. Also don't over bake this or it will be dry."
"1","5","I doubled this exactly and it turned out perfect. Had to bake about 10 minutes longer. I used a 9x13 baking dish. It was not dense, dry or heavy and did not have a flour taste at all. Everyone in my family loved it! Will definitely be making again!"
"1","5","Best cake ever! Even my daughter who doesn't like cake or icing couldn't stop raving about how delicious it is! I whipped the butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs until it looked like whipped cream. It took a little while, but SO worth it. I also alternated between adding some of the flour mix and some of the milk. Other than that, I followed the recipe the way it's written. I only make 2 cakes a year (1 for each kid) and this is the first one I did from scratch. From now on, this is the recipe - no more boxed mixes for me! I got SO many compliments on how great it tasted! People that typically won't eat cake were coming back for seconds and thirds! BTW, I used the Buttercream Icing by Sharon Gerstman from this site, too. Delicious!"
"1","1","It was dry and heavy."
"1","5","I make cupcakes often,as I have 5 children.With birthdays,school functions,church bake sales,I use this recipe often. I get asked for the recipe so many times I keep cards of the recipe on me.I think its delicious and so do all my friends.Easy too!"
"1","3","This recipe is very similar to Four Egg Yellow Cake. It, of course, is bigger/double. This one is good, too; but not quite as good. Neither is good for cupcakes unless you're using stiff frosting - to make up for the flatness."
"1","5","Delicious, but I made it healthier by cutting the butter in half, adding in 1 pureed banana, pureed handful of blueberries, 2 tablespoons of pureed avocado, 2 tablespoon of sour cream, and 2-3 tablespoons of applesauce. 3 teaspoon of cinnamon. Also 2 tablespoon of cornstarch. The result was a light and very moist banana cinnamon cake. It is a bit blue from the blueberries, and tasted heavenly."
"1","2","This cake is very dense and incredibly sweet. It is not the cake for me."
"1","5","YES! I loved it. I Tried this recipe and it was delicious. My husband loved it. I made it Pineapple upside down - it was a hit. Thank you so much for a easy recipe (even for me) and I had everything in my pantry. Thanks for sharing."
"1","3","Ok lets get things straight here....it is a Simple Cake. It has impeccable taste however the height it gets in the oven does NOT stay once you take them out of the heat. Every time I've tried this recipe it has how you say 'Shrunk' This time I even added more baking powder but to no avail. I have been making cakes for a few years now and I love the taste of this recipe...but without it rising especially for cupcakes....I'm flabbergasted! I rated this recipe as a 3 star because I feel mediocre about it. Great taste but NO height!"
"1","4","I just tried it. It's soft but dense and feels like it could melt in your mouth. I added 1/4 cup of milk as I've seen most did in the review and I added some colorants to make it colorful. The only problem I had is that it stuck to the bottom of the pan even though it didn't burn and I oiled the pan generously. This hasn't happened with any of my previous baked snacks or desserts. Still it tastes great and I love the texture of the cake. Let's hope it brings joy to the party tomorrow. Xoxo Ella."
"1","4","Substituting cake flour for the AP flour will make a big difference in making the cake less dense...in addition to what other reviewers have said, beat the creamed mixture for several minutes. Substitute 1 cup and 2 tbsp for every cup of AP flour called for in the recipe."
"1","4","I liked it very much BUT BEWARE! DO NOT PUT IN the FRIDGE!I did the mistake of putting the cake in the fridge because I used a cream cheese frosting & didn't want to run the risk of it sitting & going bad. SO when it came to cutting the cake it was hard as cardboard...TRAGIC lol"
"1","4","Just what I needed... something simple and without a lot of ingredients. Also, easy to make dairy free using coconut milk and coconut oil."
"1","2","This was the worst cake I've ever had. I followed the instructions exactly and it came out tasting like cornbread."
"1","5","This cake is amazing!! I needed a simple white cake that I could make lactose/dairy free, and this one worked well. I used vanilla rice milk and vegan margarine, and the taste was fantastic.   I used several other suggestions of adding about a 1/4 more milk than the recipe called for, and it did aid in making it less dense. As this was for a large birthday cake, I was able to triple the recipe without any issues."
"1","5","I changed the recipe based on the 'Most Helpful Critical Reviews' and it was perfection! I also added poppy seeds once which was an interesting (positive) difference. I use this recipe for every kind of cake I want. It's solid!"
"1","4","This was wonderful, I did add 1 tsp salt and extra milk and butterscotch chips (only because the person I was making it for loves butterscotch) and it came out great. Everyone at the party I took it to enjoyed it. Also it does make two 8' rounds. The key to this is really creaming the butter and sugar and then the eggs one at a time, then half the milk and half flour mixture till combined then add the rest in and incorporate.  I was asked if I had used a boxed cake mix. :)"
"1","5","This was so easy to make and it was moist and light. A perfect recipe to add any flavor you want or simply keep it as is."
"1","2","Very disappointed in this cake. It turned out SO heavy, and the flavor was lacking. :("
"1","1","I'm sorry but i absolutely hate this recipe, it was nasty. I made some cupcakes with a lemon filling so they needed to be refrigerated. I put them in the refrigerator and ate one the next day, the cupcake was rubbery and nasty, and it wasn't because of the lemon filling(I made them before plain and they did the same thing) over all, its plain and atrocious!"
"1","4","I was looking for a recipe for Hummingbird cupcakes and they all seemed to call for boxed white cake mix. I added 1 Cup of toasted coconut (I doubled the cake recipe) and 3/4 C of drained crushed pineapple. Delicious!"
"1","5","I give this cake 5 stars it is very tasty and easy to make. I'm making it for our relay for life party. It doesnt call for any unusally ingredients like some of the others I have tryed. I plan to use it alot. I make cupcakes all the time so I will try to use it for them. I just made 12 of these one for each of the birth months plan to ice them in the birth month colors. :) I did not change this recipe a bit"
"1","1","I cut this recipe in half to just make 2 large birthday cupcakes. I cut everything EXACTLY in half and followed directions perfectly....it came out HORRIBLE. I gave my 4 year old one, and she actually used the word 'Disgusting'. I tried it, and she was correct! It tastes like dough. Maybe it needs more sugar in the recipe... this was extremely plain and did not taste at all like cake. Tasted more like baked pancakes."
"1","5","Super easy!!  Followed it exactly with my 3 year old helper... it turned out perfectly :)"
"1","5","This could be the best white cake from scratch!! I creamed the sugar and butter for 5 min and sifted these dry ingredients. Made 12 regular size cupcakes and they were very fluffy and good!"
"1","1","Let me preface this review by stating that I have been cooking/baking for almost 40 years and I have had my share of successes and failures. I made this cake with the suggestions of other bakers such as additional creaming time, and extra milk. I doubled the recipe to make a 2 layer cake.  I have to say it was the worst cake I ever made. It did not really rise all that much, was way too dense (denser than my pound cake which everyone loves and requests I bake.) I did not know how badly it would taste. I even went through the trouble of making a homemade blackout cake filling to make it a black and white cake. When I cut it, it did not have a tender crumb and the taste was terrible. I really don't know what I did wrong and how many people rated this 5*. Maybe I will try it again and repost with what went wrong."
"1","1","Tasted like cornbread! Very disappointed!"
"1","2","This might be the worst white cake recipe I have ever made. The cake could not be more dry. The kids took one bite  then just ate the frosting! It needs oil or applesauce or something. I only cooked it for 16 minutes. Oh well, it was made with love."
"1","5","This is a wonderful cake and easy to make also. I have to agree with other members that it tastes like a really good sugar cookie.  Thank you Scottosman, for this great recipe and I will let all my friends know about it.   iota"
"1","5","This was such a simple and tasty recipe. Prep time was so quick! I did make some modifications to make it a little healthier. Instead of 1/2 cup butter I used 1/4 cup smartbalance and 1/4 cup greek yoghurt. Instead of 1 cup granulated sugar I used 2/3 cup agave nectar. The feedback was great! The cake was light and fluffy."
"1","5","Delicious! Made it twice , the first time using cake flour, the second I used all-purpose flour and made coffee cake using a struesel top from the quick coffee cake recipe on this site, I recommend adding 1/2 cup sour cream or plain yogurt to keep the cake moist"
"1","5","I just made this minutes ago and it came out fluffy and soft and comforting. I have a lot less guilt in eating sweets I make vs store bought with questionable filler ingredients. I substituted light coconut milk for milk and it did change the taste I'm sure but I enjoy it. I had to add a little more coconut milk to make it smooth like a typical cake batter since coconut milk is thick but other than that no other adjustments. I don't use milk because canned milk (coconut, evaporated, condensed) lasts me longer thus saving me money.  Not too sweet, not too anything, just baby bear ??.  Thank you for sharing this. I feel comfortable enough to add, lemon/lime zest for some pop or orange or cinnamon for a treat. This has given me new confidence in my baking! Yes! THANK YOU."
"1","5","I followed this recipe exactly and my cake came out fluffy and moist. Delicious with or without icing. Best cake I've had in a long time. I will use this over and over again, forget store bought!!!"
"1","5","YUM!! This is a FANTASTIC cake! I doubled the recipe so I could make a layer cake. I also used half Splenda and it turned out GREAT! I couldn't wait for it to cool to level the top and give it a taste. Will definitely make this cake again!"
"1","5","I made this cake just as the recipe says. It tastes wonderful, it's very moist and was a big hit. I will definitely make it again and again."
"1","4","I feel like it's missing a component that I just cant put my finger on. But! The outside is sorta crispy while the inside is light and fluffy! Overall it was great!"
"1","4","Followed the recipe had to double it for a 9x13 sheet cake and the cake fell in the middle - twice. I had fresh baking powder, do not live at high altitude and oven has been calibrated also have an oven themometer. I did follow others advise about thoughly mixing the butter and sugar, don't know what went wrong. Tastes great but sunken."
"1","5","Great base recipe! I used egg replacer though, and white rice flour because of my family's allergies. I also used water instead of milk. Turned out scrumptious! :D"
"1","1","Well this must be a low altitude recipe. Thank goodness I tried this the day before the birthday party that I need to have the cake for. It just kept growing and growing and growing and there was probably enough batter on the bottom of the oven to make another round. Absolutely horrible. No idea what it tastes like but if you live in a high altitude area make adjustments accordingly."
"1","3","It looked great and baked evenly and everything however I thought it to be a little dry for my liking. I defenately think it needs some kind of vegetable oil added somewhere in the batter. Also the cake itself wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, not that I wanted it really sweet or anything but I used a whipped cream frosting and I didn't make it that sweet because I thought the cake would be sweet enough to make up for it. I'll make this cake again but with some changes next time."
"1","3","I have to say. This recipe has NEVER failed me. Except for today. First off, the heat or time was WAY off for the cupcakes. First time making cupcakes with this recipe, but unfortunately, the cupcakes weren't done on the top/middle, and the bottom was WAY TOO BURNT. I would suggest 325 degrees farenheit and bake it for 15ish minutes on the top rack. I would have given this a five. But today was so.... Disappointing. Will try again tonight. Wish me luck. :)"
"1","5","It was the best homemade white cake ever and it was really easy to make. I all be using it all the time. i highly recommend it>"
"1","1","1) Where's the salt?? 2) It doesn't stay together. Flaky isn't my goal for cakes. 3) It doesn't taste good. What little flavor it had from the vanilla is overpowered by cooking spray and flower. A very disappointing cake."
"1","5","Great recipe with the few changes most recommended. Does using cake flour make the cake any fluffier?"
"1","2","This recipe was nothing like what I expected. The cake was rather dense and too heavy. It was not nearly sweet enough - it's cake, for crying out loud! If not for the delicious buttercream frosting I put on it, I don't think I could have eaten it."
"1","5","Perfect cake for 'building' a children's birthday cake with (i.e. nice firm texture that doesn't crumble and lends itself well to slicing and constructing 3D cakes. In my case, my sun requested a tobogganing hill cake). All the kids (and adults) loved the flavour of it as well. A few modifications: I used slightly more milk then the recipe calls for. I quadrupled the recipe and made two 9X13 pans which means the cakes took slightly longer to cook through (about 50 minutes). The original recipe is as stated not enough to fill a 9X13 pan but doubled it is perfect. I covered the cake with tinfoil at approximately 30 minutes to prevent further browning. Lastly i used a buttercream icing. Delicious."
"1","2","I followed this recipe to a t and must say the top was flat and cookie like and the inside crumbly like corn bread!guess i'm still on the hunt for a cake recipe"
"1","3","I was disappointed in this recipe. It had an odd texture. I was hoping for a nice moist, light cake and it turned out more dense and breadish. So sorry but I won't make it again."
"1","4","My first batch turned out amazing! I took some suggestions and I put in a cup of milk instead of the 1/2 that's written. As long as you follow the directions you should be fine!"
"1","4","this is a really good recipe, altough i found it a bit too heavy for my liking and added an extra 1/2cup of milk. otherwise it tastes awesome!!!"
"1","5","The most important part of this recipe is creaming the butter and sugar really well, then adding the eggs one at a time - beating thoroughly after each addition. These steps really make a difference in recipes that are heavier in eggs and flour, like this one. My cupcakes turned out fluffy, with delicious vanilla flavor. This is such a simple recipe as well - will use again and again (got rave reviews from my children and in-laws)."
"1","4","Great basic recipe, i added my own touch with 2 tablespoons amaretto and a pinch of cinamon. yum."
"1","5","I made this last night for my daughter's class party today. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more milk, (upped to about 3/4C) and it was still a thick batter. Very easy to spoon into cupcake liners! I did not sift anything, but I didn't pack the flour into the measuring cup either (you're supposed to always spoon flour into the measuring cups, not scoop and pat, which may be why some people are getting the dense texture). The cupcakes came out fluffy and moist. And it really does taste like a sugar cookie! Overall, I'd have to say it was an easy, low-stress recipe and the finished product got no complaints!"
"1","5","So moist and amazing- I dont usually like cakes and this was so yummy! I followed the advice from the reviews to add more milk / vanilla. PERFECT! I also did the Buttercream frosting which I did a 5 star rating on."
"1","1","I love to bake and am always looking for new recipes, but I was very disappointed with this recipe. Other people have said it tastes like pancakes or biscuits and that is exactly what it takes like. I tried a second batch to see if I could fix the taste but I had no luck."
"1","5","I've made this cake recipe over and over again for friends and family. This recipe is extremely moist and delicious... even eating the batter raw is yummy... licking the bowl afterwards has always been my favorite. However, this simple white cake will be in my recipe box for years to come. You can also add to it as well if you wanted it to be chocolate, or have fresh fruit, you can add other flavors than vanilla such as butter, or peppermint if you're wanting a holiday cake, try adding nutmeg and a little clove or cinnamon... trust me, you can't go wrong with this cake right here! It's wonderful! Deff a 10 star recommendation!"
"1","3","I found this recipe to be very dry when made as instructed. Adding a little extra milk baking or layering it with a moist filling like jam or ganache would have gone a long way in making this recipe better."
"1","4","the recipe was great, but there was something missing. Next time I'll add salt and maybe use buttermilk."
"1","5","I use this recipe several times a month, and I LOVE it! So simple, and whips up quickly. Up the milk to 3/4C, use that whisk attachment, and beat the everloving heck out of the butter and eggs. This recipe makes a perfect 2-layer 6' cake."
"1","5","I am so glad I read the comments before making this cupcake. It was perfect and moist. I was hesitant to try it (I am very new to baking) I am so gratful for all the tips I added a 1/4 cup more milk and an extra tablespoon of vanilla. I made sure to beat beat beat and watch the oven. I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN!!!"
"1","5","This came out absolutely perfect! The secret is that you must warm your butter to room temperature and always use the correct measurements! I can't really cook and know just about nothing when it comes to baking, but i can assure you that once you bake this cake just once, you will fall heads over heels in love with it! Definately worth your time, effort and materials! :D"
"1","5","best cupcake recipe..:)"
"1","4","I find that I reach for this recipe often. It turns out the same everytime I make it. I have used it for cupcakes and little Halloween cakes made with little bundt pans. It isn't sweet or very flavorful so it is perfect for pairing with a lot of sweet frosting or adding flavors like lemon or pineapple. Its a great little basic recipe."
"1","5","Made this last night when I was craving to bake but had limited ingredients! EXTREMELY easy and delicious - tasty and great texture & not overly sweet. Used almond milk instead of normal milk and it worked perfectly. Thank you!!"
"1","5","Tip: Read as many reviews necessary before making this great, simple, tasty cake. I made the cake yesterday evening. I beat the cream, sugar, and eggs for a good 10-15 mins. Make like Michael Jackson and BEAT IT! Really!! One review suggested that you beat the cream, sugar, & egg mixture until it looks like yellow Cool Whip...and I absolutely agree. I slowly added the flour & baking powder mixture. I used 3/4 - 1 cup whole milk. The cake is not overly sweet but it is a good balance of sweetness and it was very moist. I made a butter cream frosting and this was a great addition. My daughter is 9 and she loved it, my husband said it was very good, and I have had 3 slices."
"1","4","Tasted like a sugar cookie"
"1","5","I have made this cake several times using water instead of milk and earth's balance instead of butter--it was so delicious! Now that I'm no longer avoiding dairy, I tried the original recie, which is also yummy, but I still can't get over how good it was without dairy. Love it!"
"1","5","First off, I think the cake was amazing. Before making the full cake, I started off by making a small portion. The portion smelled eggy, so I added more vanilla. I did not have butter, so instead I used half a cup of canola oil. I know, it seems ridiculous, but it was a birthday and the cake still tasted great. I didn't add any frosting because in my opinion, it tastes better without it. Perfect taste, amount of sugar, and color.   Summary of changes : Canola oil substituting oil, 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup, 3 tsp vanilla instead of 2 tsp, and was baked for a little over 35 minutes."
"1","4","i tried this recipe for the only reason that the title says white cake since i wanted a base to make a rainbow cake. The color turned out to be yellowish but the taste is great, easy and quick to make. Although the color turned out to be yellowish i am still going to give it a try, i might need to use more food coloring...."
"1","5","This is my new 'go- to' base cake for everything now. It is simple, dense, and incredibly well received. My mother (who is a professional baker) really enjoyed this when I served it. For variations, I've added almond extract and lemon extract for different flavors. Truly an excellent, simple white cake."
"1","5","Was looking for a yummy but simple cake recipe that my 4 yr old could use to make me a birthday cake - this was definitely the perfect one! Had everything all ready at home, quick and easy, made a wonderful yummy soft cake!"
"1","5","Best white cake recipe with slight modifications. Instead of milk, I used half and half just because that is what I had. For the butter, I used half butter, half shortening. Wow! This was so moist and yummy! I have been very skeptical of white cake recipes but this one is a keeper!"
"1","5","I really loves this recipe. I love how I can make it bigger or smaller depending on how much I need. I love how it takes like a sugar cookie. And I love even more that my children love it."
"1","5","By far favorite cupcake recipe. Even though the sides stick to the cupcake liners their light and fluffy and delicious."
"1","2","I've made this recipe twice, and both times it was a disappointment. I thought maybe I did something wrong the first time, so I gave it a second shot. Both times it was dry and coarse, almost like cornbread, and lacked sweetness. It also stuck horribly to the muffin pan, despite it being greased. I've never had that problem with any other cupcakes I've made, but it happened both times with these. Next time I'd probably just use a box mix instead."
"1","5","We followed the recipe exactly and it worked perfectly. The cake is amazing, and tastes like a dessert type of cornbread to me. We added a simple homemade cream cheese frosting and the combo is great. My kids loved it."
"1","5","Made it into cupcakes - turned out fabulous! Rose up nice and high."
"1","1","dense and dry cake, even after following the instructions exactly."
"1","5","Was so surprised at how easy but delicious this cake was, thanks for posting it. It is a little dense, but I was ok with that, the flavor was amazing. Wouldn't change anything."
"1","5","Made this for my son's birthday. It was a huge hit; best white cake recipe I've ever made."
"1","5","THE BEST WHITE CAKE EVER  PERIOD."
"1","5","Really easy recipe, really good cake, I only made half of the recipe so I used the 1/4 cup and like 1 tbs more extra of milk. The cupcakes came out perfect in 23 to 25 mins."
"1","5","Great cupcakes. I added almond extract for flavor and it was amazing."
"1","4","Good recipe... Nice and easy to make.. Light and fluffy. I used cake flours instead and cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup. Worth a try and will make again.."
"1","5","This is the best I've made. It was gone in nothing flat, so soft and sweat, almost reminded me of Albertson's white cake in the bakery. I was very Impressed and so was Family :) if you haven't tried this one, I say you'll love it."
"1","4","Nice moist soft cake, super easy to prepare. However, it stuck to the pans, I had to very gently loosen it from the pans with a slanted spatula. I used non-stick spray; next time I'll try coating the pans with butter and dusting with flour or use parchment paper."
"1","4","Perfect recipe for simple white cake.. i made it for 6 servings.. and its simply delicious.... very easy and tasty"
"1","5","Very easy recipe. I tripled the recipe because I needed 36 cupcakes. I must make my cupcakes smaller, because I ended up with 60 cupcakes!"
"1","5","Excellent for cupcakes!i made two batches on the smaller cupcake pan, so they were mini and heavenly! I made red velvent and a coconut one, amazing! No dense or cornbread texture here, moist, fluffy and wonderful!"
"1","4","I'm giving this 4 stars b/c I made a substitution which apparently was a big mistake. Instead of a 1/2 cup of butter, I used 1/4 cup and 4 oz of applesauce. As I've substituted applesauce for oil in cakes before I didn't think this would be a problem but this cake was a huge disappointment. The top crust was like cornbread and the inside was like a thick gelatinous pudding that never seemed like it cooked all the way through even though I cooked it 40 min in a convection oven. I'll have to try this again following the instructions exactly but whatever you do, don't use applesauce."
"1","5","My son has peanut allergies and I wanted a quick, easy and good tasting recipe. made this with my 4 and 9 year old. They did all the work. Taste great. Can't wait to add things to it..."
"1","1","I have made these 3 times today and wasted loads of product. My mom even made a batch...don't waste your time! I have to make 175 cupcakes - I am way behind schedule now."
"1","2","Too dry."
"1","5","I made cupcakes with this recipe yesterday to test out for my sons first b-day next month, they were really tasty but did come out a little dry even though I onled baked for 12minutes and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk. Overall they were yummy and I would like to make a 2 layer 9in cake with it but not sure if I should double or triple the recipe. any advice? also anyone think buttermilk would be better in this recipe and might help with the dryness? I know nothing about baking and just started recently to make baked good without a box so Im I always reading advice on here."
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for a long time. You should use 3/4 milk or more. The batter should be very smooth and more on the liquid side then tough side. But overall it's wonderful"
"1","5","It was a lovely sponge, lovely light and springy when you bite into it. The mixture was sort of minimal so if you are using the cake tin they suggested make sure you double the recipe as you will end u with a thin cake like me that finishes very fast. I put a chocolate ganache on the cake which made a nice mix of flavours."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! I made it with GF flour and it came out really moist and delicious. Actually i was out of butter and used oil, and it came out great anyway. This recipe will be my go to recipe for birthday cakes and cupcakes."
"1","5","I needed a larger cake, so I doubled the recipe. I also doubled the vanilla. Everyone loved it, will make this again, no doubt. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Really, really good cake. I made it as per the exact instructions and it was light, fluffy, sweet and extremely tasty. I made them into cupcakes and through in a handful of miniature chocolate chips into the batter. Wonderful recipe!"
"1","3","Delicious. Such a quick and tasty recipe. I feel as though it is missing a little zing though..."
"1","5","This cake is perfect!!! It tastes just like a sugar cookie. I use it for cupcakes and add chocolate frosting or vanilla frosting with some fruit, but it would be great with anything. So glad I found this recipie."
"1","5","Last week I tried the recipe, but I made cupcakes. They came out delicious. The cupcakes were fluffy and melting in my mouth. Really easy to make, fast and amazing. Thank you for the recipe"
"1","4","Pretty good, although I used wholewheat flour and it tasted a bit wheaty unfortunately - I was trying to be healthy! :)"
"1","5","I've made this cake/cupcake batter on many occasions and it has always tasted great! This last time, I substituted a rice & tapioca allergy-friendly gluten-free flour for the all-purpose flour & it turned out great, too!"
"1","5","It was really good i added a 1/4 cup extra of milk and substituted half of the butter for shortening. DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","Amazing!, I searched for a new recipe for a more moist and fluffy cupcake, this one is perfect but I most add a comment, I followed the recommendations of another costumer of adding 1/8 more of milk and a full tablespoon of vanilla extract"
"1","5","made this cake. turned out beautifully."
"1","4","The cake deserves five stars, the recipe on the other hand a four, I ended up cooking it for one hour because the centre was still gooey at 40 minutes. It came out lightly golden on the outside it was quite a heavy cake although it rose so well :) as the cake cooled I noticed how crusty the outside was as I saw in other reviews so I mixed some milk and icing sugar almost half half and glazed all over the cake and sprinkled some cinnamon on top it was soooo perfect! My hubby and his best friend loved it, all gone :) they couldn't believe it was from scratch so simple!"
"1","5","I've made this several times and it always turns out perfect. I had to make slight alterations due to dietary reasons. I used almond milk and I increased the flour and milk to accommodate the pan I use. Also in the last cake I added cinnamon and it tasted like the cake equivalent of a snickerdoodle. Yummy! Bottom line is this is easier than a box mix and tastes way better."
"1","5","This is a very good recipe and very cheap to make!!"
"1","5","I love this cake! The crust tastes like a cookie! It's a wonderful dense cake and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly each time, the single double and triple recipe versions. All the different size cakes baked well and came out beautifully. My new go to cake!"
"1","1","very dry. . ."
"1","1","didn't like this very much. would not make again. stuck to pan, fell apart, not a good flavor at all."
"1","2","Unfortunately not what I was looking for. It was missing salt and wasnt as vanilla-y or as sweet as I thought it would be. I dont have a lot of time to dr it up, maybe some day!!!"
"1","5","Instruction and ingredients were simple and easy,baked for the first time in my life and it turned out to be great"
"1","4","The recipe is simple and I did read other reviews. I did sift the flour and mixed the ingriedients a little at the time. I even added a little more milk & vanilla. However, there seems to be something missing. It doesn't taste bad, but maybe if I add a little salt next time that will balance the recipe. Even my husband said, it taste funny, but I told him it was just missing something. I made a simple buttercream frosting. Overall it is light and still taste good. The cake texture held together and was light and fluffy. I love to bake, but there isn't anything I can think of that would help other than a touch of salt."
"1","4","i tried this cake ..came out vry soft n yummy..tuk this cake with my eggless choco cake to a lady's get together...n guess wat i won 2nd prize..thnx for d recipe :)"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious cake! I've had so many compliments. I added a bit more milk and a bit more vanilla per my own tastes, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Also, I've made a sugar-free version with splenda that also tastes great. This is for sure my go-to white cake recipe."
"1","5","I really love this recipe. I made it as the base to my maple bacon cupcakes, and it was perfect for that. It's sturdy enough to hold up to bacon chunks but still really fluffy and awesome. Make sure you use soft butter and beat the out of it to get it nice and fluffy and full of air! This is my new go-to vanilla cupcake base, no changes needed! The batter was a texture that is new to me as far as cupcakes go - it was so airy and almost like a thick whipped cream consistency. I could have eaten a whole bowl of that by itself! As far as the people that have said they are dry, I think they're probably overcooking them. You need to keep a close eye on your baked goods! Mine only needed about 16minutes in the oven and they came out perfect."
"1","5","Followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I made it for my nephew's birthday, and everyone enjoyed it. They couldn't keep their hands off of it."
"1","5","So simple and so delicious! Made cake pops out of this and added 1 more egg to make sure it was moist. Everyone loved it!!!!"
"1","5","i added sprinkles to the recipe and it was yummy it tasted just like the funfetti cupcakes! I will bake this again :D"
"1","5","I really LOVE....this cake. I just finished baking it :D It's a very simple recipe. I made it for cupcake and added rainbow sprinkle on top of it. My daughter loves it very much. Thank you so much for the recipe."
"1","4","I beat the heck out of this at every step, per everyone else's advice. Added 2 tablespoons extra flour for HIGH ALTITUDE adjustment. Baked a dozen cupcakes and 6' cake. Cake is moist, dense and tasty...not even frosted yet. A keeper when in a pinch (meaning I don't have a store bought mix and need to make cupcakes!) Thanks!"
"1","3","I overcooked it slightly, but even so it was exceedingly dry."
"1","5","I love this recipe!  Simple but delicious and easy"
"1","5","Great and easy to make cake! Tastes like package cake mix but homemade."
"1","4","Finally, a truly simple cake recipe. I added 3/4 cup of buttermilk instead of regular milk. and the batter was really smooth. I made 12 cupcakes, they smell great and are really light, will try tomorrow. and will frost with something: )  they were almost overdone after 18 minutes @350."
"1","5","This is a great recipe. However, I will admit that I didn't leave it alone the first time I made it (couldn't help myself). I did beat the eggs for about five minutes after adding them, and I added about 1/3 cup of strong brewed coffee and a teaspoon of fresh orange zest. As a special treat for my daughter, I made half of them into purple cupcakes. They baked up perfectly in 20 minutes, were good and moist and fluffy. I filled them with vanilla pudding and used cream cheese frosting - my family gave rave reviews."
"1","4","Good cake! I took some strawberries from last week and made strawberry jam. I covered the cake in the jam and topped it with flaked coconut."
"1","5","awesome recipe! I followed others and beat sugar and butter for 10 minutes. and beating well after each egg. I doubled recipe and added a 1/2 cup extra milk making 30 cupcakes."
"1","5","This recipe is so easy yet so delectable. Pair it with homemade frosting and the picture is complete. Actually, I ran out of milk when I was making it today, so I substituted hot chocolate in instead, making sure to keep the cocoa powder at a minimum so it wouldn't turn out too sweet. It turned out a little darker (about the color of whole grain bread) but was still moist and delicious.   Thank you so much for sharing."
"1","4","The batter was much too thick to split evenly by cups to make layers even though I added a splash of milk after it was all mixed. I think next time I'll add 1/4 cup of boiling water to make the cake moist & help it cook faster. It's what I do with my chocolate cake & it is the best. Other than that, the cake tastes great and because it's thick, it is easy to put it to cool in a wire rack without it breaking. I just wish I hadn't ruined it by adding that Duncan Hynes canned frosting. Next time, we'll eat plain cake than add anything from a can that's not whipped cream."
"1","4","Easy, versatile and delicious. I doubled the recipe and added green food coloring for a St. Patrick's Day party. They turned out beautifully, but a little dry. Probably because I had to make them ahead of time and they sat in my cooled oven overnight."
"1","4","This is definitely an easy recipe. Like most other reviewers, the cake does have a cornbread texture, however if you follow the recipe step by step...it's delicious!!! I would recommend adding sone extra milk as a previous reviewer stated.   I recommend this recipe for any potential baker looking to start off simple; eg. The 8 yr old baker ^_^ looking to bake something other than the boxed cake. Enjoy!"
"1","5","This recipe was amazingly easy to follow and make. My sister and I made a batch for my mother's birthday, and they were a great hit!"
"1","2","I was not happy with this cake. It was far too dense for me. I followed directions exactly and at the end, would have preferred eating boxed cake mix cake."
"1","5","Great recipe, but I find that this recipe needs to be doubled for a 9X9 inch cake."
"1","3","This cake did not work. I followed the directions exactly as written, NO modifications. By the time the inside was cooked, the outside was way over cooked. And the rest of the cake was dry and had the consistency/taste of cornbread. Reading through the reviews, a lot of people are making modifications to add more milk, decrease oven temperature, beat the eggs for a specific length of time, etc. THAT is the kind of thing that needs to be explained in the recipe. If reviewers are having to make modifications to the ingredients in order to make their cakes work, I don't think that counts as a successful recipe. I did end up eating the cake (after drowning it in frosting to cut out the dryness), but I don't think I will make it again."
"1","5","awesome very versatile my new go to cake and cupcake"
"1","5","Very moist and heavy. I'm not normally a fan of white cake but even I enjoyed it!"
"1","5","I put chocolate chips in it its already gone"
"1","5","I dont like making scratch white or yellow cake but this cake is moist and delicious, thanks"
"1","4","This cake was amazing!!! Its very dense and mosit. It was so delicious!!! I recommend this to everyone."
"1","5","I made some changes in the recipe because i can not have dairy products. I used 1/2 cup canola oil instead of butter and rice milk instead of cow's milk, even with the changes my cupcakes turned out perfectt!!! moist and very tasty... Just follow the directions and the order you add ingredients."
"1","3","I am on the search for the PERFECT WHITE CAKE recipe. This cake made the top2 in color and texture. But for tasty it was not what I was looking for. I did only make a half batch for a tester. (I've made a lot of cakes lately) This cake was moist and crumbly and tasted much like MY moist and smooth cornbread recipe. We tried this cake half frosting with a white frosting (homemade), so the we ALL could sample it with and with out frosting. Sorry I will Keep looking!"
"1","3","This recipe was okay. It is almost exactly the same as the Magnolia Bakery Vanilla Birthday Cake recipe, which I really like. I wanted a layer cake, so I doubled this recipe and split it into the two pans, adding the extra milk that others suggested. Given the amount of batter, it took around 45 minutes to bake the cake and it definitely had that cornbread texture/flavor. It was tasty but nothing like what I expected. If making a layer cake, I would suggest dividing the doubled recipe among 3 cake pans, as they do in the Magnolia recipe. It stays much moister because it is cooked a shorter amount of time."
"1","5","Wonderful simple white cake. I had to use soy.milk (1/2 cup) because i ran out of regular milk and it still came out amazing. I also experimented with a little raspberry extract and the result was delicious cupcakes with a slight hint of raspberry flavor."
"1","5","Not much of a baker but these were simple and very delicious. Made cupcakes for my Valentine, wanted to make from scratch. I did follow other recommendations and increase milk to 3/4 cup, and added another 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Yum!"
"1","5","These DO taste like a sugar cookie, delicious! My only complaint is that this recipe really makes more like 13 or 14 cupcakes, so the 12 I made overflowed their cups and were difficult to remove."
"1","4","Great and quick recipe. I made cupcakes and topped them with frosting. Yum."
"1","4","I love this! I just tried it and it worked out really well. Has a great old fashion flavor and was a great base cake. Changed out milk in favor of Jasmine tea, and added a little extra vanilla. Perfect tea cake! ^_^ Thank you so much!"
"1","4","Very good white cake. Perfect for birthday cakes. Did add 1/4 cup of milk, as per suggestion of others. Only gave 4 instead of 5 stars just because it could of had a tad more flavour."
"1","5","I made this cake this morning and made a mistake...I forgot the butter. I figured I would cook it anyway. It came out almost 'bready' but sweet and delicious. I followed the other common recommendations written by other reviewers but just forgot the butter. Oops but yummy!"
"1","1","Dry, dense."
"1","1","I made the recipe exactly as it says and it came out dense, with a corn-bread consistency and not light and fluffy at all! If you try this recipe, make sure you add more milk as recommended by other reviewers. I don't think I will be making this cake again. If I had made a box cake, it would have definitely been better tasting, more moist than this recipe."
"1","5","I was looking for a simple recipe to practice my cupcake icing with and these were perfect. I didnt add any extra milk because I used extra large eggs and I used 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract instead of teaspoons. Perfect. I even used 1% milk because it was all I had on hand. Fluffy and moist. I cant wait to decorate these with some cream cheese frosting"
"1","5","This one's a keeper! Easy & perfect!"
"1","4","I followed this recipe exactly as written but my cake turned out a little crumbly. The taste was delicious though. I think next time I'll need to beat the batter longer in the electric mixer to get the cake to hold together better."
"1","4","Good simple cake, nothing really outsanding about it. It is nice that it makes a small cake. I used it to make 2 6 inch round cakes. I also added 3/4 cup of milk."
"1","5","I made this as a christmas treat for my neighbors and they loved it! So thank you."
"1","4","this cake was good. reminded me of a gluten freebaked donut we eat!"
"1","5","I love this recipe! I make it every Christmas in my silicone snowman 'pan.' it fills it perfectly, comes out beautifully, and is tasty all on its own. After reading a few others who have used dairy-free ingredients and had luck, I will make a second one this year for my son to enjoy. Thanks!! YUMMY!!!!!"
"1","5","This was a fantastic cake!!! I made it for my son's 6th birthday on 12/17/11. I used the Spiderman cake pan from Party City. Due to my son's food allergies, I had to substitute with rice milk, earth balance soy free butter and egg replacer. The cake still came out amazing. I will definitely use this as my go to white cake recipe. THANK YOU for a great recipe - nice, quick & easy!"
"1","5","This is by far my favorite Vanilla recipe for cakes and cupcakes alike. I wouldn't make any changes! I have used it for a few years, and I am not about to change. My only suggestion is to double the recipe if you are making it for a bigger crowd than your family. Def. 5 stars!"
"1","3","I originally gave this recipe a 5 and unfortunatley I had to change it to a 3. This recipe makes awesome cupcakes but a terrible cake. I increased the milk as suggested by the other reviewers and had light fluffy cupcakes. The do have a flour typee taste if eaten right out of the oven but does taste like a sugar cookie once cooled. The cake version of this was terrible. I did not rise and looked more like sweet bread. With each version I sifted the flour. I like the simplicity and the affordability of the ingredients, but I will not make this one again."
"1","5","I followed the hints to add 1/4 cup more milk and beat the sugar and 1/2 Crisco 1/2 butter for 5 minutes. The cake got rave reviews..no more boxed mixes for me!!"
"1","5","My 3 year old daughter and I made these. Easy and delicious. Even my mom who has been baking for ever thought these were great! Simple and amazing flavor!"
"1","1","Very 'floury' taste. I made 3 recipies to try for a wedding cake and this one got the lowest score by far."
"1","5","I've made this cake several times and its always a hit!!!!!!"
"1","5","made this last night for my sister and cousin's birthdays. i tweaked the recipe, following the suggestions of some members. the cakes turned out to be so moist yet fluffy. i finished them with buttercream frosting. everybody loved them!!"
"1","4","This cake is simple. Cream your sugar and butter well; if you're not sure whether or not it is well-combined, cream your mixture about two minutes more. 	I made this a cookies and cream cake because there are moments in life when a bag of Oreos is needed. Actually, it was because I forgot to buy a major ingredient for the cake that I originally planned to bake. )-: 	Because I didn't want the aroma of Oreos conflicting with that of the vanilla extract, I decreased the vanilla extract to 1 tsp.  	I crushed 18 Oreo cookies into small pieces, added it to my batter, and filled my 9-in. round cake pan. It took 40 minutes for batter to turn into a wonderful cake that my younger brother ate huge slices of. It was not exactly flavorful but had more of that subtle, oh-yeah-that's-good taste. I was worried about this recipe at first, but the texture was not similar to cornbread (thank gosh).  The cake presentation was lacking because I didn't add frosting which was a VERY smart idea. A whole cup of sugar was enough to make the cake sweet but not like sickening sweet.   Next time, I'll bake it in a bundt pan and sift powdered sugar over. (-: If you do so, watch the timer because the cake will bake faster."
"1","1","I followed instructions exactly but a big chunk of the cake stuck to the pan when I flipped it. Incomplete instructions."
"1","4","I made this cake and added strawberry glaze and whipped cream... my coworkers loved it!"
"1","5","This is a simple but great tasting cake. I normally make cupcakes and they always disappear pretty quickly ;)"
"1","5","Good recipe. I'd make again. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","Very good for cupcakes, they taste exactly like sugar cookies, very moist and yummy!"
"1","3","This cake was overall pretty good. The texture was perfect, and it was easy to decorate in my layer cakes and stuff. But, the flavor wasn't the best. It tasted kind of bland and had an after taste. What did I do wrong? Is it supposed to be like that? Somebody please answer me and give me some suggestions on it and thanks."
"1","3","Not much of a fan. I'd really give them a 2 1/2. I made this recipe for cupcakes for my kids Halloween party at school. I doubled the recipe and added the extra milk like some suggested. The cupcakes came out flat and tasted like flour. I did add extra sugar to the batter that I had left over and that did make a difference. Maybe I will try them again and see if they work out, if not I will x this recipe out."
"1","5","I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it so much that I had to double the recipe and bake another (bigger) cake the next day. Thanks for sharing it."
"1","5","Wow!!! Delish!!! This tastes like a sugar cookie in cake form! I made these into cupcakes and baked for 23 minutes and they came out perfect! (I also doubled this recipe to make one 8' x 3' high round and 5' x 3' high round cake... baked 5' for 50 minutes and 8' for 60 minutes.)"
"1","5","My goodness this is the first time I made this recipe and it is fantastic!!!!!!"
"1","5","Just finished baking this recipe for cupcakes and they are delicious! So moist and buttery that it melts in your mouth! I added about a cup of pumpkin puree which gave them a golden yellow color. I will use this basic recipe again and have some other flavors and ingredients in mind to play around with. Thanks allrecipes!"
"1","5","This was delicious and by far the best white cake recipe I've tried -- so easy, and the perfect size for a small family. I didn't have any whole milk, so I used buttermilk. It came out moist and delicious."
"1","5","pretty good cake, simple, super moist cause i added a little more milk, and tastes so good with one whole tablespoon of vanilla.vanila Ice cream on the side makes great combination :)"
"1","5","I am new to making cakes from scratch, this was my second time ever - first white cake - and it turned out AMAZING ! I followed the recipe exact - I made it into mini cupcakes, so it took me a couple batches to get the exact timing right but I ended up being content with cooking for 12 - 13 minutes. SO DELICOUS ! So simple !"
"1","5","Just made this cake for the first time--made cupcakes and cooked for 25 minutes. Delicious!!!"
"1","5","Simple, basic, perfect. I have made this cake a number of times comes out perfect every time. I use different frosting and filling every time and this cake goes so well with any frosting. Takes a little longer to bake but all ovens very."
"1","4","this is a good recipe. I made it according to the directions and felt it was a little to thick so I added a little more milk. it came out great its very dense and does taste just like a sugar cookie."
"1","1","awful cake rose 1/4' and there is nothing white about a while cake with egg yolks in the receipe."
"1","4","i made this cake but made very many changes. I used earth balance for the butter, brown sugar, 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white flour, soy milk....it was good but needed a sprinkle of sugar at the end to increase the sweetness or some frosting whichever...i cant give it a star bec i changed the ingred but overall it was good :)"
"1","4","First time using this recipe and plan to make a few adjustments next time: less flour, more milk and possibly more vanilla (but I use real not artificial flavoring)"
"1","5","super easy white cake. i really like the texture not being too moist and a bit dense. i gave them 5 stars instead of 4 because hey are just so easy to make. i made these cupcakes and frosted them with white chocolate cream cheese frosting from the zuccotto cupcake recipe. it was a perfect not too sweet combination with these cakes. yummy. a go to basic cupcake recipe. i also made a 9 inch layer cake and that turned out great as well."
"1","5","DEEEE-LISH! I even make cupcakes from this recipe (9 cupcakes, 400 degress for about 15-20 minutes). Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","My 3 year old son and I made this cake today... it turned out excellent!"
"1","5","it was so good i was on angel heaven"
"1","5","This cake is delicious! It's my #1 go-to cake recipe!!!"
"1","4","I really liked this it's just missing something and I haven't figured it out. My favorite addition is 1/8 th tsp of almond extract(yum)! I use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose so my recipes tend to come out a little too heavy in this recipe I just added 3 TBS of milk."
"1","5","This was very delicious. I made it at a friends house first because I was bored, then I made the exact same recipe at a sleepover. I'm about to make it my third time. Yeah, it was THAT good. it's very simple and very fast and TASTY. It's amazing. Actually, it doesn't deserve five stars, on a scale of 1 to 10 it's 100,000,000,000 :)"
"1","3","Hey everyone I found that I had to add 2/7 of water to make it work so watch out"
"1","5","I followed this recipe to a T, except I subbed in Blue Diamond Unsweetened Almond Milk, and but the recipe in half. I made two small half moon Japanese style cakes for my boyfriend. These cakes are great for cutting to make layered cake! So moist, fluffy and yummy. Be sure to hand mix for a long time to make more air."
"1","4","Yum! It was really easy to make. I used 3/4 cup milk but otherwise followed the recipe and made cupcakes. They were really light and fluffy."
"1","4","the cupcakes were good, but they almost tasted like cornbread. when i made this recipe, i added 1 tbsp of milk to make it more fluffy,more sugar, extra vanilla, and a tbsp of almond extract for extra flavour. and with some icing and spinkles on top, it makes a good cupcake!"
"1","5","Made as written and it was a fantastic cupcake! Very light, fluffy, and perfectly vanilla~ I agree that it tastes like a sugar cookie :) My airbake cupcake pan took about 30 mn. to bake. Made 12 pillows of heavenly cake! Make sure you cream that butter & sugar first! Follow all the directions to a T and you will be happy ;) Mm mm good!"
"1","5","Excellent to make a multi-layer cake !"
"1","2","it dries out very very fast. It does taste good. Next time I would make sure to frost right away to try to preserve the moisture."
"1","5","This is the BEST cake/cupcake recipe I have found. I use it every time I make cupcakes. Everybody loves these. I add some almond extract to the batter for added flavor."
"1","5","Delicious, moist and easy to make. This one's a keeper!"
"1","5","Great recipe. I bake a lot, and many of the recipes I find for cupcakes are dry or too dense-or fall in the middle. These were perfect. I followed the directions exactly. I'm at sea level and in a humid environment, so maybe that had an effect on how they turned out, but I will definitely be making these again."
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out light, but a little dry and bland. It was definitely NOT better than a box cake recipe."
"1","5","i made these cupcakes for my boyfriend and he loved them!"
"1","5","Excellent and tasty! When a new neighbor moved in unexpectedly, this recipe saved my hiney and gave me a chance to give him a superb welcome gift... cupcakes anyone? :D"
"1","3","I am a novice baker so there is a chance I did something wrong, but I wasn't too impressed with these cupcakes.  First batch I cooked for 20 min, the recipe says 20-25. They were way over cooked! Next I tried 15, better but still too much. Last few I tried 14, better but still a bit too well done. (Yes I did have them on the middle rack)  The batter had tasted great so I was expecting a nice flavorful cupcake. I actually found them to be a bit bland.  I will probably try the recipe again and add a bit of salt to help bring out the flavor."
"1","5","This cake is delicious. I made cupcakes and modified the recipe a bit by adding 3 tsp of lemon extract for the first batch, and orange for the second. The cake is moist and delicious!"
"1","5","My 13-year-old daughter and her friend made this and it turned out so good I had to get online and check out the recipe - wow - easy and delicious! They added sprinkles to the batter for the rainbow effect. Love how it isn't super sweet."
"1","5","I found this recipe a month ago when looking for a vanilla cake recipe for my son's birthday and over all, made about 10 batches in about a week! I made sure to read the reviews first and am glad I did. The recipe definately needs some tlc to make it great! I used my kitchenaid mixer with the whip attachment to whip the heck out of each step. I used all butter and the cake was very nice. I found cupcakes only took about 18-20 minutes and not as stated. When whipped, it makes a nice, fluffy cake batter. A wonderful vanilla cake recipe!"
"1","5","A really tasty cake! Was quick and easy fix when my spongecake went awry. I made this for my sister's birthday with a rhubarb compote filling between layers and with lots of berries. It was a hit!!  A few alternatives, however:  I cut the sugar down by at least a half cup and it was great. I also added more milk to make it less thick (about 1/2 to 1 cup) and it was even better. I ran out of vanilla extract so I added 1 teaspoon almond extract and about 1 to 2 teaspoons of vanilla sugar (you can get it as specialty stores or at swedish food stores as vanillinsocker). I also added a little bit of cocoa powder and if I remember clearly some cinnamon. It was delish!"
"1","4","I liked it a lot. I added a bit more milk and cinnamon to half of the mix (i used a muffin tray to bake it). Next time I will add some lemon zest and maybe use less sugar, just a bit less."
"1","2","I am very disappointed. I did a moch trial to see if my son would like this for his birthday cake. Not only did my 7 year old not like it, but neither did I. I adjusted the recipe after reading around 10 different reviews. This is what I adjusted: powdered sugar instead of granulated, 1 extra tsp of vanilla, 3/4 cup of milk and about 3/4 cup of Oreo crumbs. The cakes appearance turned out great, but I took a bite and was completely disappointed. Nothing fabulous at all, bland if I can say so. I'll just stick to a box cake."
"1","4","Pretty simple and good"
"1","4","I will have to give this cake only 4 stars because the recipe had to be altered, sorry. Definitely need to add more milk per me and the other reviewers. I doubled the recipe and added 1.5 cups of milk to my batter. Next time I might put 3/4 cup regular milk and 3/4 buttermilk into the batter. I can't say it 'tasted like a sugar cookie,' but texture and the taste is what I needed and wanted."
"1","5","These were super good! It's even better if you add Oreos and make them Oreo cupcakes!"
"1","4","first cup cake iv'e made from scratch!!! SO EASY! I wonder if you add a little bit of veggie oil it would make it more moist."
"1","5","The best cake recipe I've ever used. It's become everyone's favorite! I use skim milk and it's still delicious."
"1","4","Great basic cake recipe. Simple and easy to adapt."
"1","4","UPDATE!! I MADE THIS AGAIN AND ADDED A SMALL BOX OF VANILLA PUDDING! DELICIOUS!! VERY VERY MOIST AND SOOOO TASTY!This is a good basic cake!"
"1","4","Very good. The cake can dry out a bit if you are not serving right away. I have added an extra 1/4 c milk and that seems to keep the moisture in. I also filled the cupcakes with lemon curd and topped with meringue to make Lemon Meringue Cupcakes. I've never gotten the cornbread problem others have written about. The texture has been soft and fluffy especially with the added milk."
"1","5","I LOVE this cake. So simple but decadent. Yum! :)"
"1","5","This recipe is now my go-to for cupcakes and cake. Very moist and dense, always a crowd pleaser! Make sure not to overcook .. I always do less time than listed."
"1","5","I just made this for my son's birthday cake and it is so delicious! I did as others suggested and added 1/4 cup more milk. It really does taste like a sugar cookie. I did double the recipe to allow for two 9-inch round cakes and it was the perfect amount. This is officially my go to cake recipe now! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","I made this cake for a client using whole wheat flour and it came out amazing!"
"1","5","It was DE-LI-COUS. Im posotive that the next time I make it I will eat the whole cak by myself. Theres one thing though. What kind of frosting can be used? It was a great cake but im sure frosting would make it taste even better."
"1","5","This cake is awesome! I baked it for mothers day, and my whole family loved it! I used a 9 inch diameter circle pan and it turned out great!"
"1","5","Followed other reviewers and added 1/4 cup milk and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. These cakes are easy to make and absolutely wonderful!"
"1","5","An excellent, easy-to-make little cake recipe! Took me about 1/2 an hour to do a dozen cupcakes from start to finish! Very tasty with a cream-cheese icing! This will definitely be my go-to recipe for white cake from now on- almost as easy as using a box mix- but it tastes so much better!!"
"1","4","Great cake. Very simple and tasty. To change the flavor, I add a box of pudding mix and a little extra milk. SOOOO awesome. I give this cake 4 stars"
"1","3","I felt like the recipe needed more milk and a tad bit more baking powder. My cupcakes looked a bit dry/dense and were not very fluffy. I may try again w/ the slight modifications."
"1","5","Made cupcakes and they came out great. Added extra vanilla because thats what I like! Oh yeah, and a bit more milk at the suggestion of others."
"1","4","Searched all over the web for a basic white cake recipe and found this one. I was happy with the cake, but a little disappointed in myself for using a glass baking dish because each serving had to be carefully coaxed out of the dish.  I used my whisk instead of the beaters on my mixer as suggested by another reviewer, but since I haven't made it before I can't tell you if it made any difference in the texture."
"1","5","I made it vegan and it was really good. It had almost a pound cake testure when I was done with it. I really liked it though. I'll make it again and make a layer cake and ice it. I used ener-G egg replacer, plain soy milk, and smart balance light."
"1","5","This is simply the best cake ever!"
"1","4","I made a six layer cake (three batches halved) using this recipe and it went over really well, especially with the kids. The people who said the cake had a sugar cookie flavor were right. Three people told me that yesterday when I served it. It is a little richer and a little more dense than a regular white cake, but it's really delicious!"
"1","5","This was awesome!!! I made this cake yesterday. I created 48 mini cupcakes baked for 25 minutes. The cake didn't taste good when it was eaten straight from the oven, however, when it cooled, the result was a fluffy, spongy, bouncy cake with a sort of glaze? on top. Today, I tasted 1 and it was heaven!!!! Still the same soft, bouncy and spongy texture BUT the hint of vanilla and milk were more pronounced! Will make dozens more in the future! Thanks for the recipe!! God bless!"
"1","4","Doubled this recipe to make two dozen cupcakes for my niece's birthday party. I followed the recipe exactly, using real butter and whole milk. The cupcakes were perfectly baked after 22 minutes. I paired them with a vanilla buttercream frosting. The vanilla flavor was very strong. The cake was dense and moist; it did not remind me at all of cornbread. When I make this recipe again I'll probably cut the vanilla."
"1","3","I just made this cake, and was disappointed to find that the rise was incredibly minimal. I doubled the recipe and used two 9' rounds hoping to make a 4 layer cake, but the two rounds came out so short that I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that now :(. However, I do like the texture/fine crumb of the cake and the taste."
"1","5","Simple and delicious!! Recommend doubling because it will disappear fast!"
"1","5","This cake was delicious! It was fluffy and not too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly as asked, and made sure to use room temp ingredients. I also beat the butter and sugar for 10 minutes and then another 10 minutes after adding the eggs. The dry ingredients were sifted before I incorporated it into the batter. I then folded the dry mix in with a spatula without over mixing."
"1","5","This is amazingly easy and sooooo good, by far the best cake I've ever made from scratch-- so moist!! I went ahead and substituted all-purpose flour for cake flour just for a bit more smoothness. YUM!"
"1","5","This was a very simple and delicious recipe. I agree you should add a little more milk for a very moist dish. Beat the eggs very well so the batter is more fluffy and make sure the butter is blended, mix for a little while!! :-)"
"1","5","This is an excellent cake in both texture and taste. I followed the advice of earlier reviewers and beat well after each addition, and then some. It resembled pudding when I put in the pan to bake. I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","I think I know the answer to everybodys problems with this cake. I made this cake as cupcakes and it was amazing. we are making it again today for welcome home cupcakes for family coming back from Italy. with the cupcakes we make a glazish buttermilk frosting with a couple tablespoons milk, about a stick of butter, and a few cups of powdered sugar. It comes out with a gazish texture sort of like donuts. if it isnt working add about another tablespoon milk. I know its a weird recipe but you have to try it because its amazing. but, I must give credit to this amazing recipe that tastes really, really, really good!!!"
"1","5","great, a little easier with less steps than the heavenly white cake."
"1","5","The cake is great! We had a cake craving tonight and were out of cake mix. So I googled 'simple cake recipes'. The other problem was the recipe called for milk and we were out. So I substitute vanilla flavored non dairy creamer (diluted a little). I was so happy when it was done that it still roze properly and looked like a normal cake. I let cool and used canned vanilla frosting - was perfect, heavy like a nice bakery bought cake and only took minutes to make - great recipe!"
"1","4","WOW, I cant bake, ever, Every cake Ive ever made has not turned out. I made this one and not only did it turn out it tastes good! It has a semi crunchy sweet top so I didnt even frost it! Fabulous. So simple too."
"1","5","LOVED this one. It was simple to make and everyone loved the flavor. I used it to make cupcakes. So good it really didn't even need frosting!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and my cupcakes turned out great. I think the only way these would ever turn out dry is if you overbake them. Adjust the cooking time according to your oven. I have a really hot oven so I only baked them for 13 minutes (when they browned on top and when a toothpick inserted came out clean). I topped them with a lemon buttercream frosting. Yummy!"
"1","3","They were just okay."
"1","5","I just popped the cake in the oven! This is the second time I am attempting to make a white cake! I made one yesterday, but even the batter was disgusting!With this batter, I'm SURE it will be delicious!!"
"1","5","This is an amazing recipe. I've made it so many times to celebrate birthdays and special occasions at school. I have tripled the recipe and it has always turned out well. Rave reviews from students!"
"1","5","Easy to make, great taste. I made cupcakes and they tasted even better the day after I made them."
"1","3","cake was ok. little on the heavy side. not a moist springback cake."
"1","4","The cake was definitely moist. I chose to add buttermilk the remaining milk to the batter. the 1/2 cup of milk that it is called for is surely not enough. I used the creamy chocolate frosting recipe from this site and it was great."
"1","4","I made cupcakes with this, and they were great! However, I'm actually calling them a sugar-cookie cupcake, because that's exactly what they taste like. I also got more then 12 cucakes- I got 12 standard-sized and ten minis, filling them just over half. They rose very well, and were a big hit! I'll make these again, but with a bit less sugar."
"1","4","This was a really great birthday cake. I had to double the recipe to make a double layer cake, but I made it twice and both times it was very good. I will use this again as a great white cake. I made a homemade cream cheese icing and it was delicious!"
"1","4","I used this as the base for a cookies' n cream cake - it turned out very well - I baked in two 8' round pans and it was JUST enough - not sure if I'd have to double for 9' round pans..."
"1","1","Made this twice, once with cupcakes, keeping the original recipe the same...and once as a cake, adding 1/2 cup milk extra. With the cupcake recipe, it was very dry. With the extra milk, still was not good at all! Goes to show you can't always trust the ratings, very frustrating!"
"1","1","it was not quite as saticficing as the picture, it was dry and had barely any flavor, however it did make an excellent corn bread(:"
"1","1","this cake was absolutely extremely bland. i followed the recipe exactly and even added the extra 1/4 cup of milk suggested by some of the other reviews, however all that did was make the batter easier to pour into the cupcake pans. No, i did not over cook/ under cook them, they were just unfortunately not something that i would ever suggest to someone or make again."
"1","4","I followed the recipe for the most part, adding the extra 1/4 cup of milk, beat the living daylights out of the butter and sugar and after each egg addition, and used one reviewer's suggestion at alternating the flour and milk at the end... and these turned out just okay. Okay taste-wise, okay consistency, just okay. I'm hoping that icing will take them to another level. I gave it four stars for the simplicity of the ingredients and the consistency of the batter, but otherwise 'meh'"
"1","5","moist."
"1","4","A great base cake. I followed the receipe almost exactly, but using more milk and a splash of French Vanilla Syrup. It was terrific. I have so many things I would like to try to mix into this cake. Fun!!"
"1","5","My family loves this...great taste without being too sweet. Also, it has a great texture."
"1","5","This cupcake was easy too make and taste great too, I think I will use it as a stable and add flavors to make it my 'own'"
"1","5","1/4 cup more milk like a review mentioned. Made this so many times, I've lost count how many times! This is a super soft milky cake. It's a sweet cake and an absolute heaven in the mouth! :D"
"1","5","Excellent. I did half butter half shortening. Also added lemon zest. Topped with a spread of strawberry jam and cream cheese frosting. They were a hit!"
"1","5","I used 3/4 a cup of almond milk, instead, and the cake came out PERFECT. I've been bragging to my mother about my cake-making abilities for the past few days."
"1","5","Very easy and very good!"
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe proportion wise but a great variation is to substitute 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of lemon juice for the 1/2 cup of milk to make a nice lemon cake and substitute lemon extract for the vanilla extract."
"1","5","If you like coconut this is what I did...I used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp coconut extract instead of the 2 tsp of vanilla. I made cream cheese frosting and added coconut extract to that and I also sprinkled the tops with shredded coconut! I made these cupcakes for my mother in laws birthday and they were a huge hit! I will use this recipe from now on! It was easy and delicious!"
"1","2","My friend and I made these cupcakes because we were bored. They didnt turn out well at all. Buuuut..that may be because we didnt have butter (so we substituted it for crisco), we didnt have cooking spray or cupcake liners. When we pulled them out of the oven they were caved in, instead of puffed out. But they tasted pretty good! :) and when we took them out of the pan they got VERY crummy.. I wouldnt blame the recipe though...it's probably just us!"
"1","5","I made this cake, and used the advice of adding and extra 1/4 cup milk and I made it with chocolate, to make a marble cake...and it was delicious! My family loved it...I will be making this cake, for a birthday party! Thanks!"
"1","3","It was decent but a little bland."
"1","4","Very simple, easy & delicate white cake. Although not very sweet at all. I halved this recipe & baked in a 9-in round. It was the perfect amount for one layer in my 3 layer 9-in round cake. 2 layers chocolate, 1 layer white & covered in whipped cream... YUM! I also added a touch more milk - prbly 1/4 or 1/8 cup"
"1","4","This turned out very good - simple to make; it was a little dense, but not bad. I kind of preferred the density to a lighter, fluffier cake to be honest. I was expecting them to be a teensy bit more moist, but I think that once I stopped comparing them to boxed cake mix, I realize that they really are so much better and the moistness was fine. I will definitely make these again. Overall, a very good recipes."
"1","4","It's a good cake. It is a little on the dense for my liking but great if that is what you are looking for. Tastes just like a sugar cookie!"
"1","5","Fabulous...so good I didn't even use frosting! Thank you."
"1","5","I was looking for a simple cake recipe that was also moist. I found a keeper! As is this is an excellent recipe!"
"1","4","Great simple recipe. I used the recipe to make a rainbow cake. It was delicious. Thanks a lot."
"1","1","I did not care for this recipe. Not only did it have a cornbread like texture, it also tasted like cornbread! Not sweet at all!"
"1","5","I have never had so many compliments from a recipe as I do this one! It's perfect. Change nothing! It's simple and perfect"
"1","4","This was okay...made it in a 9' pan as directed...the batter never evened itself out so it was kind of thick on one end and thinner on the other. It tasted fine though. Next time I would make sure to spread the batter evenly to avoid that problem."
"1","5","Used this recipe to make cupcakes. They are yummy! They rose beautifully and I just the right amount of batter for 12 cupcakes. This will be my go to recipe for white cake. Thanks!"
"1","4","cake is slightly too sweet for a sugar cookie (i make mine with lemon zest), but still really good. i tripled the recipe to make 2 10' layers and it was about one and a half. next time, will quadruple. oh yeah, and added extra milk like everyone else. the batter was EXTREMELY thick, more like dough, even though i beat the snot out of it in the sugar/butter phase. still tastes good though."
"1","5","Great recipe. Delicious cake. I've added this to my personal recipe scrapbook. My daughter and I made it twice in one week! Try it!!"
"1","5","Excellent! I love making cakes from scratch!"
"1","5","This is the BEST cake recipe EVER!--I read the reviews concerning the moistness,so I used extra light olive oil for the butter,& then used 1/2&1/2 for the milk.If you add the milk & flour alternately,the dough will come out fine.It is DELICIOUS!!! Even better after a couple days-very moist! Good with chocolate frosting-YUM!"
"1","4","I was extremely pleased with this cake. I'mnew to cooking, so this was a perfect, simple, yet delicious recipe to start with. The cake was extremely moist and delicious. Great starter recipe for a new cook and a delicious and dependable one for even the most experienced."
"1","4","I was so hesitant to try this recipe, but I was looking for a white cupcake recipe for my daughter's 1st birthday, and I came across this. I don't think I've ever seen such mixed reviews on a recipe on AR before!! I decided to give it a try before the party on Sunday. I beat all the ingredients very well, kicked up vanilla to 1Tbs, and added 1/4 extra milk. They turned out fabulous! Obviously, it's a simple recipe and it's not going to be bakery-quality... But it was really yummy out of the oven, nothing like cornbread. I got 17 cupcakes out of the batter, and only baked for 18 minutes. (I froze most of them, to use on Sunday. I hope it'll still be good.)"
"1","4","I made this cake and found it very easy to make. Although I didn't like it that much (I never seem to like my own food for some reason), my family loved it and ate the whole thing in one day(including my sister and nephews). I would definitely make it again!"
"1","1","sorry but mine turned out horrible it tasted just like cornbread! i'm not sure what happened"
"1","5","I loved this cake...the only changes that I made to the recipe was I used french vanilla flavoring in place of vanilla extract and I used 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup."
"1","4","Tasted good...but a little dry for my liking. Made into a 'tye-dye' cake, looked great!"
"1","5","I made these last weekend for a party and they came out wonderfully. They were light and fluffy. I will most definatly make these again."
"1","5","THIS is my go to recipe for a fuss free, pretty quick& super delish cake. follow the recipe 'exactly' as it is and you will never need to look for another ever. works well as a cake or as cupcakes (takes me 25 mins to make large ones). can be modified to incorporate flavors or colors. i'ts very forgiving! like other reviews have mentioned, don't stir, don't mix, just beat it really, really well to incorporate a lot of air, pour into your pan and voila! thank you for this."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. It makes a very tender crumb. I really beat the eggs into the butter mixture well before adding the vanilla and flour. Like another reviewer said, the batter should resemble cool whip after adding the milk. I also always beat in 1-2 tblsp. vegetable oil at the end to increase moisture and keep the cupcakes from being too dry- a common problem with many cake recipes in my opinion. Everyone just loved them, a big hit in our house!! One of the only recipes I've found that's just as easy and better than a box mix."
"1","3","cake was good - not the decadent rich and moist cake i was hoping for but not too bad considering i already had all the ingredients on hand."
"1","5","i thought this recipe was fabulous. i tried it on a whim and as i was making it i was thinking wow this batter is pretty thick. then i read the reviews every one said add more milk and i was like oh poop i should have added more milk. long story short im glad i didnt. its dense and delicious, and i didnt find it dry at all... this is my new GO-TO cake!!"
"1","5","Absolutely perfect!!!"
"1","5","This is a very simple recipe that tastes delicious. I am going to use it with my beginning (absolute newbies)culinary students next week (I teach high school Culinary Arts)."
"1","5","Great cake recipe, simple and scrumptious. Made this for a 3 tier wedding cake and it baked perfectly. The bride and groom loved the flavor. I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 1 bar of shaved white chocolate to the recipe. In a different option I just added 3 tbsp of Baking Cocoa for easy to whip up chocolate cupcakes at my daughter’s birthday. I'm so glad I found this and will continue to use it."
"1","5","This cake was wonderfully simple and absolutely delicious! Even the very first time I made it, it came out moist and perfect. I won't ever buy a boxed cake mix again!"
"1","5","These tasted like the cupcakes my grandmother used to make! They had the substance that box mix cakes don't have. They were simple and yummy - I did notice that you had to be careful with baking time though! I frosted them with the Vanilla Sour Cream frosting from this site. Delicious!"
"1","5","this is a great simple recipe. i love it. i like to add 1 tsp almond extract and 1 vanilla instead of 2 vanilla. very good"
"1","5","This was a really really decent recipe. Mine came out very soft and very moist....the 2nd time around. The 1st time....was an opps on my part and left them in to long. So I can't judge for my mistake. But the 2nd attempt was spot on and I was totally pleased with how well they turned out."
"1","3","i love this. it is soo easy. I got it to make 24 instead of 12, which bugged me cause i choose it because of the 12. but i added 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa and they made awesome chocolate. and added sour milk(1 TBLS vinegar to the milk) and red food coloring(2 tablespoons) for red velvet and they turned out the best."
"1","5","Oh my WORD were these ever good! I made cupcakes. I love that they are dense and not too sweet. The only thing I did per other reviews was to add a little more milk. I just eyeballed it but it was probably close to an additional 1/4 cup. They tasted great the night I made them but were even better the next day. I frosted them with the Milky Way Cupcake Frosting recipe from this site and they were awesome!"
"1","5","I've made this like ten times already. I follow the recipe exactly and it always turns out perfect--moist, light, and fluffy. I'm not sure why some people are getting a dense cake out of this (maybe old baking powder?). Anyway, sometimes I'll use lemon extract instead of vanilla for a change. But nothing beats this great tasting, simple, quick, easy to make cake recipe."
"1","4","good, easy, quick! Came out light and fluffy with nice flavor. I came out with a 12+ cupcakes."
"1","4","i think this recipe is fantastic. you get moist, delicious cupcakes that you can do many things with. a cream cheese lime juice frosting is my favorite way to prepare these and everyone loves them."
"1","5","this is my most favorit recipe, I add a little extra vanilla for my tatse..but I love it."
"1","5","This cake is so simple but it allows such versatility. I can use a filling and ice it or just use it as the base for berries and whipped cream for a different spin. Even a beginner can make this cake with ease. Great!"
"1","5","OMG this was an amazing cake i loved it so much my little sister loved it too and so did my mom dad andd cousin"
"1","5","Simple but delicious. Perfect for a rich frosting to balance it out."
"1","5","Great and easy recipe! I substituted vanilla extract with one banana and two teaspoons of brown sugar, delicious!"
"1","5","This was excellent cake! I have been searching for a simple homemade white cake that tastes yummy, and this is it. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it came out great! I actually liked it better on the second day, when it seemed to get a little sturdier. The flavor is very simple and clean, perfect for a flavored frosting to shine. I can see myself substituting lemon extract or almond extract for the vanilla or in addition to the vanilla. I think this will be a very versatile cake that I will make often!"
"1","5","i made this cake twice in one week and it came out great both times! i tried 2 cookbook recipes for white cake before this and wasn't happy with either result. both were dry and too dense. this cake is moist and delicious! i read a bunch of the reviews and did add extra milk. i am making a 3-layer half sheet cake for a birthday this weekend, so i made 3 double batches (i doubled this recipe for each half sheet) and they all came out nice. thanks for sharing this recipe -- it's now my go-to white cake!"
"1","5","yummmmooo, i made these as cupcakes with egg replacer and they turned out wonderful!"
"1","5","This was perfect for what I wanted...an angel food cake substitute. I know... I know...completely different kind of cake, but hear me out. Since the summers out here in CA produce tons of strawberries, I was going to do Angel food cake with strawberries for 4th of July. Then I realized I would be using a whole carton of eggs...no thanks. So instead I made this cake, using 1 cup of milk (fat free) instead of the 1/2 cup, and baked them in a large muffin baking sheet (making 6 cakes). When served, I cut the cakes in half and covered it in strawberries that had been covered in sugar and sitting in the fridge for a few hours so there was plenty of syrup. The cake soaked up the syrup and the sugary sweetness of the cake went beautifully with the tart strawberries. I would recommend for everyone to try it when looking for a dessert that is refreshing but sweet in the summertime heat."
"1","5","very easy and simple! i'm not a very good baker but this came out perfectly! I added a few teaspoons of dissolved instant coffee and it tastes great :D!"
"1","4","I made this cake and it came out great! I would have given 5 stars but I did add an extra 1/2 cup milk. The texture was good and the taste was excellent. I added blueberries and a crumble topping. I am not sure what the other people were doing that said this was a bad recipe but it is going to be a staple recipe in my house for sure! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","4","really should get 4.5 stars. This cake was SO good and it definitely tastes home-made. It holds together much better and sits heavier than box cake. If you follow the recipe, as another lady said, it will be a little dry. Add a little more milk or use half the butter and 1/4 cup veg. oil."
"1","4","Really nice, easy cake. Made exactly like recipe and was a tasty, dense cake. Will make again with the extra milk and vanilla."
"1","1","My cake came out extremely dry. Even after it was cooled, I couldn't ice it without it crumbling completely. When I tried to cut it...it crumbled into pieces."
"1","5","This was simple to make and turned out perfectly when I made adjustments to make the batter vegan. I used sunflower spread instead of butter, soya milk for the milk, and egg replacer powder and water for the eggs. I also had to use wholewheat flour as I didn't have any normal flour to hand. The cupcakes still turned out great. My kids loved them. Great recipe."
"1","4","easy recipe and very tastey..just a bit dry...will add more milk next time"
"1","5","Could someone please let me know if vanilla extract is the same as vanilla essence? I'm from South Africa and haven't heard of vanilla extract. Thanks :)"
"1","3","Not overly sweet, I like that about this cake, but I wasn't too thrilled about the texture. It was a little on the dry side and puffed up only in the middle. And my worst critic is my husband, and when he says it's fine, he didn't really enjoy it too much."
"1","1","I followed this recipe exactly, and got a bad result. It had a strong egg taste, it had the texture of wet cornbread. Won't be using this recipe again, unfortunately."
"1","5","The best, the second time i made it it was hard and inedible. But it is delicious for Anything you would like."
"1","2","It to me tasted very bland, boring, and dry. Although it was very simple, I won't be making this again."
"1","5","This recipe worked perfectly for me - just as written. I loved how moist it was, couldn't have been more pleased. Beats the pants off a cake mix =) **09-28-12: note to self: very good basic cake as written. quite tall 9x13 if doubled."
"1","5","This was a wonderful cake. Light and fluffy. This only made 1 round pan so if you are wanting as much as a box mix you need to double this. My cake batter was really thick though and I had to spread it out. Great flavor. I used powdered non fat milk reconstituted. Thanks, I will make this one again."
"1","5","My son asked for a vanilla cake for his birthday. Went searching, and found this recipe. I followed other reviews by beating the batter for several minutes. The cake turned out wonderful! Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","First time making white cupcakes and it was so so good!"
"1","5","I used this to make cupcakes with chocolate frosting...it was perfect! Not dry at all, and not too moist. This is my new 'go to' simple cake recipe!"
"1","5","This recipe is wonderful! While I am a good cook I have always had trouble with making scratch cakes. This recipe came out PERFECT. Moist, tender and feathery light. I followed some of the tips of other reviewers. I used 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup, I used shortening instead of butter and added 1/4 tsp salt. I also made it by hand and beat VERY well after each ingredient was added."
"1","5","I followed this recipe to the T, and it came out perfect. Very moist and a lovely texture. I can't wait to make it again!"
"1","2","I made Jello cake with this recipe and it was still VERY dry!"
"1","5","I love this recipe! It is a bit of a heavier cake, similar to a cookie or shortbread. Goes really well with cream cheese frosting and strawberries:)"
"1","2","Followed directions exactly and was not happy with the results at all. I actually made it twice to be sure it wasn't me. Very bland, very dry and too heavy."
"1","5","Great recipe! Followed it almost exactly, except as others suggested, I increased the amount of milk to 3/4 cup, and I used margarine instead of butter. It turned out wonderful! Great taste, great texture, perfect amount of moisture. I frosted with buttercream frosting, and it was quoted as being the 'best thing I've ever made' by my boyfriend. So, thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","It's pretty good! Although it did stick to the bottom a little. (I did butter the pan) I also used a 8x8 square cake pan instead of 9x9. I made it for my mom for mother's day."
"1","5","I love this recipe! Its so quick and easy to make, especially at the last minute. I have made many cakes from scratch and this is by far the best recipe. I did find I needed a few tablespoons more milk but it all depends on how you cream the butter :) everything else is just perfect."
"1","1","This cake was dry.Tasted like a cheap mix from the dollar store. Has no taste!"
"1","3","This recipe is good when it 'works'. I made it twice. The first time I made it, it was a 'trial' version to see if it was good enough for a birthday cake. It turned out wonderful! Light and fluffy! So I decided to use it for the birthday cake the next day. Unfortunately, the second time around, the cake came out flat and dense. The taste was still good, but I was very disappointed with the texture and appearance. Will have to delete this from my recipe box because of it's unpredictablity."
"1","1","Aside from having NO FLAVOR, it was very DRY. I baked it for 30 of the '30-40' minutes as instructed and followed the directions exactly. It also had no resemblence to white cake...I was skeptical when the ingredients included egg YOLKS for a WHITE cake, but I added them anyway. I considered making this again with only egg whited, but I don't want to risk it."
"1","5","This cake is wonderful! In response to those that feel the mix needs additional milk, I think the variation in moisture could come from the variation in how the flour is measured. I always weigh my flour so it is correct every time. If the flour is measured correctly to 1 1/2 cups it doesn't seem to need additional milk."
"1","5","Moist, tasty, easy. This is the best mix for muffins i've tried so far."
"1","5","I used this recipe to make rainbow cupcakes for my sister. They were delicious! I let the butter, milk, and eggs get to room temperature and I made sure to really cream together the butter and sugar, so the texture was like coolwhip. I also sifted the flour and baking powder together, added an extra 1/4 cup of milk, and made sure to beat the eggs in well. The batter was light and fluffy, and the cupcakes were sooo moist. Great recipe!"
"1","5","i LOVE this recipe! i actually use it as a base for a few different little twists i add to it. i take some fresh fruit (strawberries, pineapple, oranges, ect.) and cut them up and put them in the food proccessor and then add them to the batter after its made and bake it and it always turns out amazing. this is by far my faveorite cake recipe just because of its versatility."
"1","5","I could barely stop eating it! Best home made cupcakes I've ever had. I didn't change a thing to this recipe, perfect as is."
"1","5","This recipe consistently makes delicious, perfect cupcakes. And, they're IDEAL for decorating as they're firm and hold up really well to being handled without crumbling. Every time I make these, people rave about them."
"1","4","I made cupcakes and they turned out wonderful. I didn't even have to add the extra milk that alot of other reviewers say to add. I recommend this recipe."
"1","4","i stumbled upon this website and found this recipe and it was like mmmmmmm so good! thanks so much x"
"1","1","This recipe was a complete disappointment. I added extra vanilla and milk as suggested by other reviewers; however the cake was still flavorless."
"1","5","amezing........! It turned out to be so moist and great testing...thank you so much....!"
"1","5","I just love this. i know my family will too. I'm actually a pesco-vegetarian, only fish. No mammals or their products. But when i tasted a half of one of the cupcakes i was wowed, i really think the cupcake was fluffy and moist but not too much, like cupcake material. I WANT TO TRY A CAKE NEXT. THANKS. oh just one thing, i didnt feel comfortable with adding all flour and then all milk, and my mixer was having problems. So i did it like a I always do... alternating the flour and milk, starting and ending with flour. GREAT RECIPE!"
"1","3","its more like a yellow cake, i added a table spoon of instant pudding mix for moisture"
"1","4","The flavor of this cake is amazing, however it's not a good recipe to make 2 rounds and layer them. I made two cakes following the recipe exactly and they nearly fell apart when I put them together. The end result was a delicious cake, it just wasn't that pretty."
"1","4","I used this recipe to make cupcakes for the kid's after school treat. They were dense, but had a great flavor. Creaming the sugar & eggs completely is the key. I did add 1/2 cup extra milk. For those who are getting a cornbread consistency, make sure you don't over-mix after adding the flour. A great basic white cake recipe!"
"1","1","I would actually give this 1 1/2 stars....the taste was just okay. The cake batter was very thick, almost like pudding. As I expected, it came out dry when it was done. It is also quite bland--not sweet enough. It almost has an angel food (or white sandwich bread) type consistency, but I was looking for a traditional birthday cake type recipe. I do not plan to use this one again. Possibly sour cream, extra milk, and a little extra sugar would help this recipe. If you are looking for an angel food cake, this just might do the recipe you need, but if you are looking for a moist cake, a good one to try is White Almond Wedding Cake."
"1","5","This cake set up great. I did cream butter/sugar for a long time (7-8 minutes) and I also added 1/4 cup or so more milk. They do rise, so if you're doing cupcakes about one ice cream scoop is good (3/4 full in liner)."
"1","5","simple and yummy.. some of the reviews say to add more milk, which is fine, it comes out a little more moist.. i use this recipe for whenever i'm craving something baked and sweet. its not too rich, not too sweet.. perfect for cupcakes as well as cakes.. great recipe if ur just starting to bake"
"1","5","Loved this recipe, didn't change a thing!"
"1","5","WHITE VANILLA BETTER THAN BROWN VANILLA WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE A COLORED CAKE!"
"1","5","Very good. It made about 12 cupcakes. Baked in about 16 minutes."
"1","2","This should be your last choice for a cupcake...if you have limited ingredients. I followed the reviews, beat my sugar/eggs for 8 minutes and added extra milk, but its still awful. As someone else mentioned, it's like vanilla cornbread. Very heavy and startchy. Cake should not be heavy. It's just not worth your time and effort if you are looking for something amazing!"
"1","5","Way better than a box cake and very easy to make! The cake has a dry texture, just the way I like it. I added food coloring to batter to make it fun. We made pink and white cupcakes."
"1","5","This will be my new white cake recipe. I whipped the sugar/butter mixture for about 5 minutes in the kitchenaid, then added eggs for another 3 minutes. Then proceeded with the recipe adding about another 1/4 cup milk, even went on to dye them pink! I doubled the recipe and made 36 regular sized cupcakes. Light and fluffy!! YUM!"
"1","5","I will always make this cake"
"1","5","This cake is really great. I loved it. It is seriously magical."
"1","5","I used this recipe to make cupcakes and it was great. I did add extra milk (3/4 cup total) as others suggested and might even add a bit more next time. I also added chocolate chips and topped them with 'Satiny chocolate glaze' from this site. I made them for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved them!"
"1","1","NOT GOOD!! This is not a white cake, has too coarse a texture, and a very odd flavor. Plus it only made one very thin layer."
"1","4","I thought this recipe was amazing! When I made this recipe for my family, they al they all loved this recipe! I found these cupcakes were a little dry so I added some more milk and upped the vanilla a little. Other than that I thought that this was an amazing recipe to follw. I normaly find recipies hard to read but this was amazing and very easy to read... I loved it!!!"
"1","5","I made this cake for my neice and she loved it. I'd also say it's amazing, especially for the kids."
"1","5","Love it, love it!!!Fluffy and moist!"
"1","5","Amazing is not enough!! It was super easy and great! ... I was craving so much a really 'american cake' as I am Mexican living in France and here I can't find them... I've been trying all sorts of recipes and i am amazed this one was SO EASY and SO GREAT!! .. I made some 'cupcakes' and added frozen red fruits to half og them and chocolate chips to the others.... DE-LI-CIOUS!!!!!!!! gracias!!"
"1","3","This cake was easy to make but it was very chewy and had a weird flavor."
"1","3","I found this recipe too sweet, maybe lessen sugar?"
"1","5","Easy and delicious. I used 3 egg whites for the whole eggs so it was white. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","This was a great cake. Very moist it was gone in two days."
"1","4","Very sweet."
"1","5","Excellent - light and fluffy. To make this non-dairy, I used margarine instead of butter and soy milk instead of regular. We made cupcakes and the tops came out deliciously crusty while the inside was so soft. A double recipe made 24 cupcakes."
"1","3","Not what I was expecting. It was kind of dry and really not what I was looking for. I'll keep looking."
"1","2","taste was not what I was expecting or hoping for. described by husband (who hadn't read reviews) to taste like cornbread. asked if I forgot sugar, not a sweet cake."
"1","1","This recipe did not work for me. The cake was tasteless and tough. What a waste!"
"1","5","I loved this cake. It is dense with an 'adult' taste rather than a sugary kids taste. I made cupcakes and frosted with strawbery buttercream. Very light and fluffy but decadent at the same time. This is now my go-to white cake recipe."
"1","5","this cake took me all of 5 min to get ready to go in the oven very easy so yummy!"
"1","4","Great white cake recipe! I substituted margarine for the butter, and it still turned out wonderfully. Just make sure to mix/whip well after you add the eggs. It'll help them become lighter/fluffier. They're not moist and they're not dry. Hard to explain! I made cupcakes, and baked them for 20 minutes, and they were perfectly done. After cooling, I topped with a chocolate ganache - which really makes it complete. It had a slight 'overly-eggy' flavor, but the ganache was rich enough to dominate that part. :) I had also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.. but I'm not a fan of too-sweet desserts, and I knew I'd later add a sweet topping.. so 1/2 cup was plenty. I'll be making these again.. thank you!"
"1","4","I just wanted folks to know that if you use whole eggs for this recipe, you will get yellow cake, which is not a bad thing in and of itself. If you want a white cake as pictured, use only egg whites and perhaps clear vanilla. I used the stand mixer and beat everything very well and added 1/4 cup extra milk and the cake came out moist and delicious. Thumbs up from the kids. I didn't think it rose as much as I would've liked but perhaps it's time for me to replace the baking powder. I topped it with a chocolate buttercream icing and it got rave reviews."
"1","5","I don't know what people are talking about with the whole 'be sure to sift all dry ingredients very well.' and 'beat the butter until it's very fluffy.' I did not follow the directions - I threw all the ingredients in one bowl, just with the butter slightly softened and I used bread flour instead. One bowl, and a hand mixer. I got THE MOST DELICIOUS cupcakes I have ever made!"
"1","4","I like the simplicity of this recipe. You have to be sure to beat the butter until it is light and fluffy and beat the sugar with the butter until it is well incorporate, but don't over beat once the eggs are added. I suggest using cake flour, if you can, but don't add any additional tablespoons of it (as the package will suggest to you), and I replaced half of the softened butter with vegetable oil, and added about 1/2 teaspoon of butter flavor. It was a perfect cake. I've made it before, as written, and it was pretty good that way too, but with the changes, it was 5 stars."
"1","4","Easy & yummy!!"
"1","5","I made this for my boyfriend. This was a very good white cake. I think it's the first one I ever made (besides one from the box) I frosted it with buttercream frosting. I also poked holes in it and poured strawberry gelatin on it. Then decorated it with strawberries. Yummm. My family had no problem eating most of it.. there's only one piece left, and it's only been a day!"
"1","4","nice and simple. very light."
"1","5","wow, unbelievably easy recipe and it was delicious. thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe."
"1","5","I somehow ruined a box mix, but had frosting made...so looked for a quick and easy cake to go with my frosting - this was perfect. Makes a small cake, but very moist, and very easy. Thank you!"
"1","4","WOW! Amazingly simple and still quite Delicious! Pair this with some Lemon Icing/Frosting and it is a fantastic treat!"
"1","4","Very good, PERFECT for strawberry shortcake!"
"1","2","DRY DRY DRY DRY!!! I forgot to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk to this as suggested by other viewers...so I am rating the recipe as written. The flavor was good and it was for a kid's party - usually, they don't notice things like that...but I did...and I was embarrassed. I will try again with the extra milk and taste test at home."
"1","3","Maybe I did something wrong or maybe I expect too much from a simple white cake? Mine was simply sweet. That's it. I expected it will be fluffy, white, sweet, tasty and aromatic. I end up making cake ball with chocolate cover to make it tastier. Not my kind of recipe. Sorry."
"1","5","This recipe was more than I hoped for! It was short enough and simple enough that my 5 year old and I completed it while dinner was baking. It baked while we ate. And it tasted so good. He was very proud of himself as his sisters and brothers raved. The cupcakes do taste, as other viewers have noted, like a sugar cookie. Ours were dense like a pound cake but silky smooth. Fantastic even with no frosting! My only change to the recipe was to add about 1/4c more milk. We will make these again and again!"
"1","5","This recipe is exactly what it professes to be, a simple and tasty cake. I'd never made a cake of this sort before (only had experience with genoise types), but my cupcakes still turned out perfect. I added a little extra milk like others suggested, about 1/8 more than the recipe called for, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly, and it isn't dry at all. By itself it isn't a total showstopper, but it's delicious in a simple way, and it'd amke a good base. The taste of the cake doesn't demand the spotlight, so I'm sure rich icing or fruit would go great with it."
"1","5","Super yummy!! I didn't have a problem with my cupcakes being dense at all. They were fluffy and lovely. I didn't overmix after I added the flour mixture, so I think that helps. Also, I saw no need for extra milk. This recipe makes more like 18 cupcakes, not 12. If you use it for 12, they'll seriously overflow. Bottom line: Yum, yum, yum. Amazing."
"1","4","I wanted a quick and easy recipe for cupcakes and this worked for me. I thought it was going to taste like white wedding cake but it taste more like a sugar cookie. My kids even call it sugar cookie cupcakes. Mine did come out fluffy and I made chocolate icing to add a bit more sweetness. Like other reviewers stated I added 1/4 cup more milk."
"1","4","The cake was dense (even after a lot of mixing) but I like dense cake! If you like boxed cake mixes that are light and fluffy (and taste like air) this is not the cake for you. It does make a small cake though, you may need to double the recipe and layer with icing in the middle."
"1","5","Absolutly the best cake I've ever made."
"1","5","I followed recipe except for the milk, I used 2/3 of a cup. I also used a 11 inch round corning ware pan so it came out looking very pretty. Served it with sliced strawberries and vanilla yogurt (instead of whipped cream) and the family loved it. This is an easy and excellent white cake. A keeper as my husband likes to say."
"1","5","I love this recipe. This ends my search for a good white cake/cupcake recipe."
"1","4","This Cake Is Absolutely Gorgeous. I Would Recommed It To Anyone.:)"
"1","5","I wanted to try out different white cakes before making my daughter's castle cake and this or 'Cream Cake' are the winners. Compared to 'Cream Cake' this recipe is sweeter but just as good as 'Cream Cake.' I made 1 plain cupcake and 1 marble cupcake using 'Black Magic Cake.'"
"1","4","I enjoyed this cake, it was moist and dense enough to be a recipe I will use again. I did add 1/2 tsp salt, I found it odd that salt was not in the recipe."
"1","5","This was the easiest cake ever! And from scratch! I love it, and am using this as my base for most cakes now. I used rice milk to make it a dairy free cake with my good earth whipped buttery spread(it's dairy free as well) to accommodate allergies(could easily use egg replacer and make this vegan!!). I divided the batter into three sections(2 small and 1 large) and made one small blue, the other red, to make an AWESOME red white and blue cake. It was a HUGE success and gobbled up quickly. Everyone was calling it the 'magic cake'. I also increased the recipe by half to make it in a bundt pan. I'm about to make it today infused with fresh strawberries. YUM!"
"1","4","This turned out good. I was in a hurry though, so next time I try it I will slow down ALOT. The cupcakes were a hit though...no one had any complaints! It had a good vanilla flavor which I liked alot."
"1","3","This was the 1st cake I've tried to make from scratch. I thought it was okay. The cake seems a little spongy not light and fluffy like it should be. I made this last night and tried one of the cupcakes and it tasted like it had oil in it even though it doesn't. I tried one today(after they set overnight) and it didn't have that 'oil' taste, and was quite a bit better tasting, but still lacking the light fluffy texture that I was looking for."
"1","5","Very good, simple cake. I thought the texture was fine-- it's not like sticky box mix cake. Like other people, I did have to add a little extra milk. My husband and his co-workers loved it."
"1","4","Tastes like a regular made-from-scratch, dense, white cake. Like another reviewer commented, the taste did remind me a bit of a sugar cookie. I baked it in a 9-in. round and it turned out great."
"1","3","This is not white cake. It tasted like shortcake, I ended up having to make another cake. Although I did turn it into a good cake, just wasn't what I was looking for. I used creamcheese and coolwhip frosting and strawberries in the middle mixed in. It was tasty but not what it claims to be."
"1","3","Simple cake to make. Mine came out a bit dry around the edges but all in all it was an easy, tasty cake! thanks!"
"1","4","I needed something quick and easy to make when I couldn't find a cake mix in my cupboard and these did the trick. I mixed them plenty in between each addition and they fluffed right up and looked very pretty. I only gave them 4 stars because they didn't taste as great as I hoped."
"1","4","this was a good cake... good for double layers..."
"1","4","This recipe was very easy to follow. The cake tasted standard to what white cake usually tastes like, so that's good! I'd like it to be a little more moist, but for the most part, the cake turned out delicious!"
"1","4","tastes great, made cupcakes. Only problem, the tops did not hold a 'muffin-like' dome, and stuck to the sides of the pan and had to be cut out. Otherwise, great and easy."
"1","5","This was perfect! I whipped it up quickly and it was amazing. It made a very very tall 9' round. I made sure to whip everything together very well and it ended up VERY fluffy! I used the Banana Butter Icing recipe for the topping and this was very light and refreshing- perfect for summer- thank you!"
"1","4","This is a nice, dense blank canvas-type cake. (I would have given it 4 1/2 stars, as it wasn't the best, but pretty good.) It isn't too sweet, and it doesn't have much flavor by itself. I put a strawberry/diced mango combo on top and frosted it with whipped cream. I cooked the cake in an 8 by 11 inch glass pan, and it turned out perfectly."
"1","2","It had a nice taste but I really did not like the texture, it was very dense and crumbly. I am not sure if I will do it again."
"1","4","This is a simple and easy recipe but the cake wasn't very fluffy. I used only 3/4 cup of sugar, which was perfect for us. I made this for the Coconut Poke Cake recipe from this site."
"1","4","It turned out ok."
"1","4","A tad sweet and could be a bit more moist, however....a very easy, quick recipe. I had everything on hand already. Would use again - thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","this is the first time i made cake from scratch...! got the best review ever!!! a review from my hubby! He loves it!!! He even brought some in the office for lunch..! sooo proud! thanks"
"1","2","This is a 'yellow' cake, not a white cake. It's okay, moist, reminds me of corn bread. I wanted a white cake. I did add the extra milk too."
"1","1","Not fluffy at all. I had to double up the recipe for a 9' cake."
"1","4","This didn't turn out to be exactly the taste I was looking for, but even so, the cupcakes were delicious - maybe I creamed the butter and sugar TOO much because the end result reminded me of a buttery sponge cake-like texture. I frosted them with Browned Butter Icing and the combo was a great treat!"
"1","5","Good basic recipe. I made it into strawberry cake by adding a pkg of strawberry jello."
"1","5","simple and delicious! i cinnamon and ground cloves (to taste). as stated before, batter should resemble yellow cool whip."
"1","1","i was expecting something fluffer but instead it was heavy and way to dence i would never made it again"
"1","5","I've never made a cake before where I spent so much time beating the butter and sugar. After reading the other reviews, I made sure that I beat the butter and sugar for 10 minutes and WOW what a difference it made!! I'll never not do that ever again. I made this cake with the Special Buttercream Frosting also on allrecipes and filled it with an instant pudding mix (vanilla) and it was devoured in less than 24 hours. It tasted just like a cake that one can buy in a bakery. This is now my go-to cake and I will never buy another bakery cake ever again."
"1","4","This was a great recipe, but I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 because it was more like a pound cake, and almost tasted like sugar cookies to me. Simple to make and tasty!"
"1","4","Simple, but very tasty. We made these into mini cupcakes, baking for about 16-18 minutes. No frosting needed, just decorate with colored sugar before baking. Great kid hit."
"1","5","This was so quick and easy, and the results were an amazingly fluffy, soft cake. Very very good. Will definitely make time and time again. Easier than buying cake mix, and 10 times better!"
"1","5","yum"
"1","5","Very good! I wanted something sweet but very simple. I love yellow cake by its self. I made the cake, cut it into small bite size squares with no frosting. It was perfect not too sweet but sweet enough that I could eat it with no frosting and it was great. Will use from now on!"
"1","3","I was very disappointed. It lacked flavor compared to another recipe I tried on here. Nothing special in my book."
"1","5","This is a fabulous recipe. The recipe is simple, great tasting, and it calls for ingredients that I think one would normally have available. Many other reviewers had commented that the cake is better if an extra 1/4 cup of milk is added so I did that, but I only beat the mixture of butter and sugar for about 4 minutes, not 8 minutes as some other reviewers had suggested. I also made sure each egg was well beaten into the mixture after adding it. Since I didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand for frosting (more specifically confectioner's sugar), I decided to make a whipped cream frosting, adding a touch of cream of tartar, sugar, and chocolate flavoring. The cake and the frosting were perfect together. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I'll definitely make this one over and over again."
"1","4","I added the extra milk as suggested, but my cupcakes were a bit crumbly. They didn't stick together enough...not that they weren't tasty. Will try again without the extra milk to see if this helps. Also, I coated the bottom of some of the cupcake liners with crushed pineapple - great treat at the bottom!"
"1","1","this is by far the worst cake i have baked, i am an avid baker and make cakes as a small business on the side. i was looking for a new white cake recipe to try. this recipe turned out like cornbread and was very grainy and dry. i made cupcakes and the batter overflowed the pan and made a huge mess in the oven. i am not sure what causes this cake to work for others wonderfully and others so poorly, but i will not be making it again, yuk"
"1","5","i have been making this cake for about 2 years...everyone loves it and saids its the best they have ever tasted. i don't change anything, but i do let the butter come to room temp. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!!"
"1","4","Very Good! Very Easy! I doubled the recipe. It made a nice 3-layer 8' cake. I added almond flavoring for a nice reminder of my mom's cooking. Someone said it reminded them of pound cake; I must agree. I am going to make it again for cupcakes."
"1","5","This is a great cake. Followed the ingredients exactly but I separated the eggs and beat the whites separately with a bit of cream of tartar and then folded them in at the end. Makes is very light."
"1","5","I vegan-ized this cake and it turned out so fabulous I am still beside myself. I used a vegan margarine in place of butter, and beat the margarine with the sugar for about five minutes before adding my egg substitutes (milled flax seed mixed with a little water) and then beat that mixture for a minute. I used coconut milk in place of regular milk and it all came together so beautifully. I let the cake set for about 8 or 9 hours before I sampled it (I put it in an airtight cake thing while it was still a little warm). It stayed wonderfully moist probably from the little bit of humidity the steam caused from doing it this way. Anyway, it was absolutely fabulous. I frosted it with a buttercream frosting that I adapted as well, and topped with flaked coconut. SO GOOD! Don't be afraid to play with this - if you think it needs more flavor, add an extract to it. If you think it was too dry, increase your liquids. If you thought it was too dense, sift your flour and don't beat the batter, fold it in instead. Play around and do what works for you. Remember in cake baking your environment (hot, humid, dry, high alt, etc) does play a role, and so there will be a lot of different results because of this."
"1","5","Reminds me very much of my mother's old pound cake recipe. Beautiful flavor. Not too sweet or overpowering, but you can't stop yourself from taking another bite!"
"1","5","I think it was great"
"1","5","Divine... read the other comments. Extra milk and lots of beating, and it came out divine."
"1","5","These are very quick & quite deelish.. I used 3/4 cup of milk after reading other reviews and they were perfect.. They were very moist and a nice golden brown.. Everyone loved them!!!"
"1","2","I am so sorry, I hate to give a bad review but I did not like this cake at all. The texture was light and fluffy but dry. The taste was not to be desired....I actually didn't even finish my piece which may be the first! It seems that it is missing some more sugar...it tastes like a 'diet' cake. I guess that is the only description I can come up with. I sifted the ingredients together and followed the recipe exactly."
"1","5","This was a fantastic recipe- thank you! I used all organic products and whole wheat flour and it turned out delicious. The best part was it was very simple and quick so I was able to bake, make icing and clean the dishes all before my son woke up from his nap!!"
"1","1","Had the texture of cornbread."
"1","5","This is my all time favorite cake recipe. I have been using this recipe since I found it and I don't think I'll ever stop. I think my cupcakes come out better than my cake, in respect to the surface color. The cake comes out a bit darker than the cupcakes which come out golden. I also add a little bit more milk than stated, I eyeball it until I feel its the right consistency. I always have what I need handy so I find myself making this cake quite often. It beats the cake mix anytime."
"1","5","Great! I modified this recipe by using soy milk and whole wheat flour, and it was yummy!"
"1","5","fantastic cupcakes I've made with this recipe :D my family really liked them...and they were my first home made cupcakes.. very easy but you just have to be patient holding the electric mixer..hehe I'm absolutely maiking them again.. thanks a lot for the recipe :D"
"1","4","I was just looking for a quick simple recipe but uhm well it was definitly simple, i actually made them into cup cake but they were quite dry. and if i hadn't frosted them with some glaze i could have just ate them as a corn bread, not quite what i was looking for but i would just suggest ad a tad bit more milk."
"1","3","I would really give these 3&1/2 *'s made this as an emergency cup cake mix, It was ok as a quick and easy but nothing very special- I read others reviews and had a hard time deciding to use the recipe or not.. I think I might have better tried another as they were quite heavy even after beating the butter and eggs for a long time. These do have a subtle sweet taste so really go crazy with your topping or your cakes will be quite bland, not a melt in the mouth sponge. I doubled the mix and added an extra half cup of milk so I woudn't say they were dry, just a bit bready as others have mentioned. I'll keep looking!"
"1","4","The recipe itself is very good but I've given it four stars because it actually needs a bit more milk than is called for if you plan to eat it the day it's baked. The recipe works as is if you can let the cake sit a couple of days before frosting. I used it to make cupcakes for my 4-year-old's birthday party. I dipped the tops of the cupcakes in a chocolate ganache (1/2 c heavy cream, 12 oz semisweet chocolate, 1 tsp instant coffee granules heated till smooth and warm). Both children and adults loved them - not too sweet and the baking soda makes them taste a bit like cut-out cookies. They were perfect with the chocolate. I made them the night before following the directions exactly, and they could have been a bit more moist but were otherwise great. I will make these again but add a little more milk next time as other reviewers have suggested. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","This was amazing! My idea of the perfect cake. I added a little more milk just because I'd read that others had. I was looking for something simple that my boys could make. The four yr old is learning letter sounds and C is for cake you know... :)"
"1","2","So, this is my old review. I have to rewrite it because when I made a cake and not cupcakes this did not come out the way that I wanted. I was not happy how the cake shrunk up and went really flat. Everyone liked it but i had to make it a 2 layer cake. Great for cupcakes, NOT GREAT for CAKES! I really did like this recipe but from all the reviews it was hard to choose which differences I should make. So what I did was 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup confectionary sugar, 3T vanilla, and an extra 2/3 cup milk. Make sure you keep the butter and eggs out till they are room temperature and beat the butter and sugars very well (takes about 5 minutes). It was really good and I will make this again for cupcakes."
"1","4","Good taste but a little dry. The second time I made this recipe I used mini-muffin tins and the cupcakes were hard to get out of the tins after baking, even though I sprayed the pans beforehand."
"1","3","Maybe it's just personal preference, but this recipe didn't come out the way I hoped. I thought it didn't taste sweet enough, and the taste reminded me of cornbread. An okay recipe, but I think I'll try a different one next time."
"1","1","I have never had an allrecipes.com recipe turn out bad until I made this. Awful! Hard, dry, and mealy. It tasted okay right after it came out of the oven but then hardened by the hour. I think I will stick to boxed cake mixes."
"1","3","This recipe is very good, but be careful when making cupcakes because they come out flat and don't really hold together. They are so good you probably won't care because they are so good, but you may not want to bring them to an event. I did not have this problem when I made it into a cake, but I did notice that it was very difficult to get it out of the pan if it cooled too much. Like I said I think that the taste is wonderful, but I just wanted to give people a heads up."
"1","5","SOOOOO easy, yet SOOOOOO Good! If you want it a little thicker, use an 8' cake pan. I didn't change a thing! No need to! I used it for 4th of July. I put a white frosting on it, blueberries in the left corner for the Stars and red rasberries crosswise for the stripes. Adorable, and delish!"
"1","5","great recipe!! next time I'll add a little bit more of vanilla extract to because I think it smells a little bit like egg. but it is the best white cupcakes I've ever made!"
"1","5","Very good recipe. I made this while cooking up the last of my food before a move, so I didn't have all of the ingredients and had to substiute some things. I used 1 3/4 cup of powdered sugar instead of plain sugar, a little over a cup of evaporated milk instead of the milk, and cake flour rather than all purpose flour. I also had no vanilla so I used one package of instant vanilla pudding. I used the recipe to make cupcakes which turned out lovely and delicious! I will make this again but with the pudding mix added in."
"1","4","This was an excellent cake! Fluffy, light, easy to make. We paired this with 'Creamy Chocolate Frosting' from Allrecipes and it was a little rich, I'd recommend a lighter frosting if you go that route."
"1","5","This is the only cake I will make anymore. It always comes out perfectly. Best of all it doesn't crumb when you frost it like some cakes do. I always make these in cupcake form for the kids birthdays for the kids to frost and it's always a huge hit. Everyone raves about how good they are, even people who don't like white cake. It's amazing how many people have never tasted real homemade cake before and it has boxed mixes beat hands down! Just as easy too ;)"
"1","2","Wow... I'm surprised after reading all of the reviews because I didn't like these cupcakes at all! I thought they were too dense and lacked flavor (I did mix the eggs and sugar until fluffy). Maybe if I had added chocolate chips or other flavoring they would have been okay. But overall, I think a .99 cake mix tastes better."
"1","5","very simple to make, had flavor akin to boxed cake mixes. my sons cake turned out perfect, and i had no problems icing it."
"1","5","A good alternative is to add a pack of jell-o of your choice (I used Strawberry). And mixing it with the flour and baking powder. it gives the cake a whole new delicious side. Loved by all the coworkers ( and the household)"
"1","4","I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and two table spoons golden syrup to make this into a moist and yummy cake. Was a great basic recipe to start adding your own take to!"
"1","5","WOW! This cake is phenomenal. I made it this afternoon and now, just a few hours later, there's hardly any left! My family absolutely loved it. Its very moist and tasty, also simple and easy to make. I think I'll try it with strawberries next time. I will definitely be making this many more times. Thank you."
"1","3","This was good, but it doesn't yeild much batter, so I doubled everything. Also, I didn't find this a fluffy cake, more of a light sponge. I cut the cake in half and filled with straberry spread and covered the entire cake with butter cream frosting - very good! I will make this again."
"1","5","I made cupcakes with this recipe and they were yummy! I used 'Creamy Frosting' recipe from this site and they were extra yummy! Read my review for the 'Creamy Frosting' and you'll see how I made three flavors out of one frosting (chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla)."
"1","4","one of the best cakes i ever made..  very tasty.. my family loved it ..."
"1","4","This was a great recipe. I added a little extra milk just as the previous reviewers mentioned and substituted the zest of 1 lemon and a tbsp of lemon juice for the vanilla. Really good!"
"1","5","Tasted like soft sugar cookies YUM"
"1","5","This cake was so great! I doubled the recipe to make a four layer cake. I also took a package of strawberries in syrup, drained them, and added them to the batter. It was amazing!"
"1","5","I've used this many times and always got good reviews, following the recipe exactly, or when tweaking it just a little."
"1","5","Yum! This is a really good recipe and it tasted kinda like Sugar cookies! I added a cup of milk, some nesquick stwawberry powder, and I substituted the vanilla for honey. Put some cool whipped frosting(also on this website). And decorated it with sprinkles and m&m's. made this for my bbro's B-day Yum!"
"1","5","Thank you thank you for this recipe!! Since I found it less than a month ago I have made it four times!! It really does make the best cupcakes I have ever tasted. They are so moist and yummy and the batter is easy to work with. As long as you mix WELL these will turn out perfect."
"1","4","Quick and easy cupcakes from scratch no less. I noticed there's no salt in this recipe so I substituted buttermilk for the regular milk. And the cupcakes turned out very good and soft inside--no cornbread texture. The ingredients are simple and basic so you can whip these up at the spur of the moment if you need a last minute dessert. Great, thanks for the recipe!"
"1","4","Very tasty, simple and easy to do. Have just baked a load for my daughters nursery class. Used buttercream icing recipe, also from this site..yum!"
"1","4","I used one and a half times the recipe to fill a 12' round cake pan. The cake was good. I had a 3 layer cake and this vanilla layer was the most dry after 4 days--still tasty though! The other layers were the New York cheesecake (from this site) and Barefoot Contessa's chocolate cake."
"1","1","Simply terrible...I followed all of the instructions AND the tips from other users but it came out simply terrible, sorry:("
"1","5","Delicious! Add some sprinkles to the mix for some nice color and decoration. Made this for my nephew and niece for their birthday and they loved it"
"1","5","Fantastic!"
"1","5","After reading the other reviews, I added a splash of more milk and made sure to whip the batter well. The result was a very tasty cake, with almost a pound cake consistency, very easy to ice."
"1","4","I usually prefer cake mixes over homemade, except for chocolate. I think I may have found a keeper here. It's not really a white cake, though. It's a yellow cake. If you left the yolks out and added 2 more egg whites, it would be white. I made this into cupcakes and they were very yummy."
"1","5","I'm not a white cake fan, though I've only had them 'from the box'. This cake has changed my opinion! The recipe really was simple, and the cake came out perfectly. Thanks!!"
"1","4","Pretty good. I halved the recipe to make 6 cupcakes. Turned out dense and buttery. Frosted w/ 'luscious buttercream frosting' from Land o'Lakes on this website."
"1","5","AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! i made it twice and both times it was amazing moist and yummy i will always make it"
"1","5","Very easy. I used half of the butter and used 1\2 cup of applesauce. I also used 4 tbls dry eggs with 1\2 water. Turned out great with creme cheese icing."
"1","5","Divine! Cake was so fluffy that my hubbie thought he was eating Angel Food cake. I followed the recipe as is. Added eggs one at a time. Used electric mixer to do all the blending. Very easy, very tasty, recipe.--I did add extra half cup of milk!"
"1","4","I have to give this a 4. It was nice and easy make!!! My son decided to to ask me to make a cake with my new Betty Crocker cake decorating kit so we did. It did come out good but not the best cake I have ever had."
"1","3","Like many of the other reviewers, I found this recipe tasty but a bit dry in cake form despite adding extra milk."
"1","5","Wonderful rich texture and so tasty! I used the recipe to make cupcakes, but even as a cake, without frosting, it has a beautiful taste and probably would be even nicer with a berry sauce and perhaps even a scoop of vanilla ice cream and...I could go on and on! This is definitely going to be my 'plain cupcake' recipe from now on."
"1","5","I used this recipe for my son's birthday party. I was a little worried when the mixed ingredients resembled cornmeal mix rather than cake mix...but the outcome was a true success. Vey moist and flavorful! Kids and adults both loved it!"
"1","5","While I had to make some substitutions due to food allergies, the results were great!"
"1","5","Perfect cupcakes but I used cake flour instead of all purpose and upped the milk to 3/4 cup as other reviewers suggested. I also beat with standing mixer at medium speed several minutes until batter was almost frothy. Cupcakes were ready after 20 minutes. Kids loved them!"
"1","5","This cake is wonderful! I have made it twice within the last week for my 2 year old who is allergic to cow's milk. I used three quarter cup of whole goat's milk, halved the sugar and I took the others' advice and really beat my eggs. I think that the goat's milk makes it dense but it was fine. This recipe made 12 good sized cupcakes and my husband and 4 year old really like them too!"
"1","3","This cake is very reminiscent of the cake portion of my mother's pineapple upside down cake. It was very dense, yet also a bit dry. I noticed a coconut taste to it despite having no coconut ingredients. It was not wholly unedibile, after all it was cake, but nothing too stellar about it. On a positive note it called for basic ingredients and was simple to make. Perhaps instead of the 1/2 cup of milk at the end it might do better with a cup of boiling water stirred in to give it extra moisture while remaining dense."
"1","3","It came out a little dense, but was completely eaten up - the whole cake! Think it would have been better with a chocolate frosting then the one I used."
"1","5","This is the best cake/cupcake recipe I have ever tried. It's good with or without icing. I add a cup of chocolate chips to make chocolate chip cupcakes and it turns out great every time. I personally use a tad bit less sugar, but everything else is perfect and it's easy to make."
"1","2","This was definitely an easy cake, but the result was very dry. Not a cake I would make again."
"1","5","Awesome! Very tasty, moist and fluffy. I did beat the eggs separately before adding to the mix. I also found that I needed to add an extra 15 minutes to the time as I used a shaped cake mould that required double the amount of cake batter. Very very good and simple too. I'll use this from now on."
"1","5","It's baking right now, so I can't really review yet, but the batter tastes excellent! I doubled the recipe then divided it into six bowls (1 cup batter each) then dyed each a different color. I'm baking them as 3 8' rounds, with 2 colors per round stacked vertically. Then I'll frost it with white frosting. It will be a rainbow cake!"
"1","5","Simply wonderful! This cake tastes remarkably like sugar cookies. My family loved it - thanks for sharing!"
"1","4","I can't have dairy products so I substituted coconut oil for the butter, coconut milk for the milk, and coconut extract for the vanilla. It was delicious. Texture was a bit more dense as described but still wonderful. Everyone loved it."
"1","5","I love this cake! It's super moist and it also makes delicious cupcakes!"
"1","5","very easy and very yummy!!!"
"1","5","I live in south Texas and made these on an extremely humid day. They turned out very springy and moist. I added 1 tsp cinnamon for a little 'kick' and used cake flour instead of all-purpose. Very happy with the results!"
"1","3","The cake turned out a bit flat and somewhat sweet but all in all it's okay and easy to do."
"1","5","I thought this was a great and easy white cake recipe. I made them into mini cupcakes and they were great!"
"1","2","I found this to be quite dry even after adding additional vanilla and milk. It was almost like a corn bread instead of a cake."
"1","2","I was not a fan at all. I thought this was way too much like a bread or maybe a muffin, not cake."
"1","5","Used this cake for cupcakes and let the kids decorate them. I loved that they were a bit dense, that way they held together while little hands frosted them. Thanks for sharing."
"1","4","Great easy quick cake to make. Like it, don't love it but it makes great, easy little cupcakes - but not outstanding. I will use it again though as it is a very easy recipe."
"1","4","I used this recipe to make my son's 3rd birthday cake. I used a 'Diego' cake pan and it was a hit. I used the suggestion from another review to up the vanilla to a full tablespoon and add an additional 1/8 cup of milk. The cake was really moiste and very taste. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"1","5","This is a great basic recipe. I made it with a tablespoon of vanilla and a little more milk. I also alternated mixing in the flour and the milk. My cupcakes turned out great! I frosted half of them with a vanilla buttercream and the other half with a chocolate buttercream. Yummy!"
"1","5","The cake was great, I did add a couple of things...instead on 2 teaspoons of vanilla, I used one teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of root beer extract and instead of milk I used 1/2 cup of rootbeer..white vanilla icing with 1 teaspoon of rootbeer extract...though I added a few things..the cake itself was great and fast.."
"1","5","These were delicious... I used a little more vanilla and a little more milk as someone else had suggested. I will definately make these again."
"1","5","I made this recipe and it came out wonderful...I loved it, I made 12 cupcakes...I would recommend this recipe..."
"1","5","Very nice recipe! Happiness guaranteed! I quirked it a bit to suit my taste (and the contents of my cabinets ^^): took out the vanilla, instead, added 1/4 of a cup more milk; added about 2-3 teaspoons of cinnamon, a very nice touch, if I must say so myself. Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
"1","5","Delicious! I served it with a whipped cream recipe on this site and raspberries."
"1","3","I had the same cornbread texture problem, but it wasn't a bad cake once it's frosted. I'll try it again with cake flour, maybe the unbleached all purpose I used was the problem??"
"1","4","This is a good white cake recipe. Don't over cook though, it can be a little dry. I added a bit more vanilla as well."
"1","1","I made this cake for my step daughter's birthday. It was awful. It wouldn't come out of the pan, when it did, it acme out in pieces, so i tasted it, thankfully. It had a horrible flavor. It didn't rise like a cake should. I will NEVER use this recipe again."
"1","3","It wasn't very sweet like cake should be, but I added butter cream frosting to balance it out. Oh, I had leftover batter and made it into cupcakes - bad idea. It's better as an actual cake."
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did not really like it. It's more of an old-fashioned, dense cake. It was not really dry, just really heavy. Sort of in-between yellow and white. I won't be making it again."
"1","4","I am really pleased with these cupcakes they turned out light and fluffy and were really simple to make."
"1","5","I made this cake and poured crushed pineapple over the top and baked. Made a delicious 'coffee cake'."
"1","2","After looking over the mostly positive reviews, I figured that I would be okay making this cake. Like other users, I had similar problems with the texture. After following this recipe to the T, baking it to the right time, I was dissapointed to find that my cupcakes just fell apart! While the taste might be good, this just didn't work."
"1","4","I made cupcakes from this recipe and the flavor reminded my of a sugar cookie. In fact, the tops were slightly hardened like a cookie, but I did leave them in the oven about 5 minutes longer than suggested. Overall, very good."
"1","3","The cake batter tasted good, and it smelled great while baking but this just wasn't a good quality cake. It tasted more like a sweet cornbread, and was more yellow than white."
"1","3","After going through the reviews, I decided to add some more milk and sugar to prevent whatever that could've happened to the cake, but it was still dry even after I added oil into it the second time. I didn't like the taste too much either. Well, my mom liked it because it wasn't too sweet so I guess it's not too bad :) we'll just have to eat it with a ton of frosting and strawberries."
"1","5","I tried 4 different cake recipes...and this one was the best! It is sooo good! It's quick, and easy, and turns out wonderful! I made little egg shaped cakes with a egg shaped cupcake tray...and I made my own icing and wrote names on top of the eggs...it turned out great! Everyone loved them! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","3","I made cupcakes with this recipe and they were tasty, especially when they had cooled down a bit, but I wanted something a little more fluffy. This cake was a little dense even though I whipped the ingredients with an electric mixer."
"1","4","I loved this recipe! I used the splenda baking mixture. I used cake flour. I also did not have enough butter, so I just used applesauce to make up the difference. I doubled the recipe- but I used only 1 egg, and 4 egg whites. Next time I will use more applesauce than butter (I think this will cut down on the crumbling/dry), and I will use no egg yolks, and I will use less baking powder. Overall, this was just what I needed. I made a topping of vanilla pudding, 1.5 cups of milk, 1 tub of strawberry whip cream, and fresh strawberries."
"1","5","I made this for my kids after school It was easy and turned out very good I changed it to 36 servings.I whipped the batter in my mixer it made it really fluffy.  Thank you for posting"
"1","5","This is really good recipe."
"1","3","This wasn't too bad. It was a little dense for my taste. It would be easy to overbake and turn out dry. Just not what I want in a cake. Very easy to make, though."
"1","5","This recipe ws great.Turned out just perfect.I was looking for a simple plain cake recipe and this was excellent.I cut my cake in squares, dipped them in chocolate sauce and coated them with cocunut flakes..YUMMY! Thanx Scott for this one."
"1","4","Very good tasting cake. It's so simple that it's hard to believe that it can be this moist and tasteful. We also added a powder sugar glaze at the end."
"1","4","I made this recipe for an experiment. Turned out well! I made some modifications: an additional 1/8 cup milk (I used vanilla soymilk) more vanilla and I even added a teaspoon of oil. Next time I'll try almond or lemon extract for a little kick!"
"1","2","this recipe was somewhat disappointing...the batter tasted delicious, but after baking the cake was very dry and mealy. it was also more of a yellow cake than a white cake"
"1","4","Being a novice cook I didn't know to cut the cook time back for cupcakes... However once I figured that out they were great. Add some food color and exchanged some vanilla extract for orange and made great Halloween cupcakes."
"1","5","I made 18 cupcakes with this recipie and they turned out perfect!"
"1","2","I did't love this cake. It was a bit dry, and kind of bland. But i'm sure with a few revisions it could be good."
"1","4","the cup cakes where great but a little dry."
"1","4","WOW!! this was so easy to make!! I never thought that baking a cake would be so easy using this recipe!! Thanks alot Scott!!"
"1","5","Great cake. Made recipe exactly and poured into 11 x 17 jelly roll pan and baked for 10 minutes. I put a blueberry filling down next then made another cake for the top. Frost top only with vanilla frosting and everyone raved!!"
"1","5","Loved this cake! I did add 1/8 cup more milk and 2T more sugar and a smidge more vanilla. It made more than 1dozen cupcakes, frosted with simple white icing for a picnic, no crumbs!! Next time I'm going to add a little almond flavor either to cake or frosting."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly, and the cake came out beautiful and delicious. It is a hearty cake - near the consistency of pound cake. The denser texture makes it easy to move to a serving dish, ice, and transport without falling or breaking apart. I served this at a birthday party, and it received RAVE reviews from all. They liked that it was simple and tasty, but not overly sweet."
"1","5","It's just great! I found it one of the easiest to make and to alter. just adding a few drops of food coloring and some matching icing and you can create something unique."
"1","2","I made this cake for a bakesale at my school and yes I do give it credit for being easy to make. But honestly, this cake tasted more like a yellow cake rather than a white cake. I think it tasted a bit too egg-y and it had such a thick, dense texture. I managed to salvage it by frosting it with lots of betty crocker's creamy vanilla frosting. (you can salvage practically AnYthiNG with a good frosting!) All in all, this is a pretty fair cake to try for a beginner.."
"1","5","This is a great recipe! Wasnt sure because of a few low ratings, but decided to try it anyway. I also added the extra milk (actually is was fat free ½ and ½) baked it in a 8' glass pan dropping the temp to 325° for 45 minutes. Plenty aweet and moist. Will be a definite keeper. Think it would go great with berries and whip cream on it too. I also like the smaller size as there are just 2 of us at home now. Thanks Scott!"
"1","4","This was indeed very simple to make. My husband was craving cake, so my 5-year old daughter and I whipped this up in a flash. It was really sweet, but not over the top. I would definitely make this again!"
"1","2","I don't know why this is rated so high. I made cupcakes with this recipe and they were just ok. The texture is too course and mealy, kinda like cornbread as some have mentioned, and it is yellowish not white. I did add an extra 2T of milk as some suggested but I'm not sure what difference it made. The taste was alright but overall these were dissapointing and I wouldn't make them again."
"1","2","I'm sorry, Me and my family were dissapointed with this cake. It was not fluffy white. Instead it was a mealy yellow. The toppings are a must with this cake."
"1","2","This does not taste like white cake at all. This cake first of all, is definitely too dense. Second, it's also too buttery. This recipe should also call for 3 egg whites, not 2 whole eggs."
"1","5","A perfect 'old fashioned' cake. Instead of adding extra milk I increased the vanilla to 2 Tablespoons and it worked perfectly. Buttercream frosting with chopped cherries and almonds gave the cupcakes a special flair."
"1","3","I made 24 cupcakes with this recipe for a wedding shower. I thought they turned out a little dense - they tasted good but the texture left something to be desired. I glazed these with the white chocolate glaze from the raspberry thumbprint cookie recipe on this site and put a whole strawberry upside down in the center of each and sprinkled with coconut - altogether yummy."
"1","5","Definitely a keeper. I added some extra milk as sujested from other reviewers, some blueberries and instead of vanilla some maple syrup and turn out great."
"1","5","I've made this recipe dozens of times and it is always a favorite. I've made it into cupcakes and into an elmo pan cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday. Always comes out perfect for me."
"1","2","Why do people rave over this cake? There are several recipes on this site for white cake that taste just like this one and they are so heavy and dry! It's not a bad cake but I'm looking for a light and moist white cake and this is just not it."
"1","5","This is the easiest cake recipe I've ever seen! I agree that it does need a little more milk, because otherwise it turns out a little dry, but it was very, very good. This is definitely a favorite in my house!"
"1","4","Excellent recipe! I've made this recipe as cupcakes a couple of times, and each time they've been a hit.   Be sure to add an extra 1/8 cup of milk. :)"
"1","4","I liked the fact that this cake was a little more dense then your usual cake. When my daughter and her friends at the cupcakes, they didn't crumble as much. I thought the taste was pretty good too, not too sweet, but great with frosting."
"1","5","I REALLY like this recipe. It has a clean flavor, bakes up wonderfully, and is quite moist even after several days. I've made it twice for cupcakes and it seems foolproof, even with my wonky old oven. I did add 1T of milk extra to control for a very dry day. Also, I add a pinch of salt (maybe 1/8 t) just to balance the sweetness.  Thank you Scott!!!"
"1","4","This was easy to mix together. It was very good, just a little dry. I did add extra milk but next time will add even a little more."
"1","5","This was easy and good! My 3 year old loves this cake recipe. I made cupcakes with this recipe and she begs me to make more.."
"1","4","I added 1/8 cup milk to make it more moist. It would have been too dry without the added milk. I may even add more next time. I used whole milk for added yumminess. I made cupcakes and the sweetness was perfect if you are going to use frosting. Without frosting it would need some extra sugar. Very easy and quick. I used an extra tablespoon of flour because I live in the mountains."
"1","4","I made this cake for Valentines day. I added more milk to the recipe to make it lighter. I made it into a heart using a square pan and a cicle pan. The girls in my Girl Scout troop loved this cake. Thanks for the recipe!"
"1","5","My 2 year old daughter really loved helping me make this into some GREAT cupcakes! It was fast easy and very good and that is quite an accomplishment on my part as I am only learning to cook!!!"
"1","5","I made these into mini cupcakes for valentines day, with pink frosting and sprinkles. My 3-year-old girls loved them, and I appreciated that they weren't overly sweet tasting. I would definitely make these again, and maybe experiment a bit with adding different flavours.  I also recommend not over-cooking them. I kept a close eye on the oven and made sure to take them out when they were just slightly brown around the edges.   Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","This recipe made great, moist cupcakes. The ingredients and directiosns were so simple I was able to use it for an English cooking class in Japan. My students had never tasted homemade cupcakes and they loved them right from the oven. Fantastic flavor!"
"1","3","This cake was very easy to make; however, it tasted very 'bread-like.' My cupcakes tasted more like muffins. However, the children for whom I made the cupcakes did not seem to notice. They enjoyed every bite."
"1","4","Easy, quick and tasty! This is a keeper!"
"1","5","this recipie is exactly what it says it is, simple and good. i made it for alarge group, once in cupcake and once in cake form, and both where exelent and quick."
"1","3","The cake turned out well and was easy to make, but I didn't care for it. I agree with the person who said it tasted more like cornbread than a cake! It just wasn't what I was hoping for - tasted kind of like it was made from a cheap cake mix."
"1","5","I needed a quick recipe immediately for St. Patick's day....I followed the recipe, dropped in some green food coloring and made cupcakes instant presto. Though there was almost not enough batter for 12 cupcakes they were light and soft and lightly sweet. Still moist the next day. Not eggy tasting. They stayed nice and green inside too! I think I'll try a cake with swirls of food colors.....a little fancy for a slap-it-together kind of recipe!"
"1","5","Home at last - best recipe ever. Thanks"
"1","5","A great cake, we really enjoyed it. I added chopped dried cherries and a bit of chopped chocolate chips to the batter, then dusted the top with powered sugar once it cooled. A very nice white cake with a light, pleasant texture."
"1","4","I took this cake to school and shared it with my friends. Everyone thought it was wonderful and I got asked for the recipe. I thought it was a little on the dry side but I like my cakes to be almost wet... Anyway, I recommend this recipe."
"1","3","it was a little drie but so simple to make."
"1","2","This is _not_ a 'white' cake. It's more the color of corn bread - as has been mentioned previously. And dense like corn bread too. I have to say this was a very easy recipe to make (I appreciate that), but that's the only thing that kept me from rating it with only one star :(  Taste: not good. Not to my liking anyway."
"1","5","Super easy and tastes GREAT! I made 1/2 of this recipe into 6 cupcakes to try it out. I whipped it alot with the fork to be sure it would be light and fluffy...and it WAS! My daughter added sprinkles to make it spotted and colorful and she LOVED it. Thanks!"
"1","4","I made this twice. The first time the cupcakes were a little dense, but I think I may have cooked them too long. The second time, I doubled the recipe and they were PERFECT. I also put sprinkles in the mix to make confetti cake. They were great for my son's birthday! Thanks for sharing this one... this was easier than a mix even!"
"1","3","A bit too dense for my tastes...."
"1","3","These are pretty good,very fast and easy.Great if your in a hurry or pinch to whip something up.We doubled it and made lots of cupcakes."
"1","3","I tried this just for kicks. Although it was simple, it tasted more like a vanilla corn bread. My husband topped it with butter and gave it to the kids for a snack. Then again kids will eat anything."
"1","5","These really are delicious and really simple to make. Also don' contain alot of butter which is always good. Definitly worth making, I like to top them off with Betty Crocker's Lemon Glaze."
"1","5","This cake was wonderful! I made cupcakes for my son's birthday & both him & my daughter loved them. I used fructose for sugar, rice milk for milk & added 1/2 tsp sea salt. Delightful!!!"
"1","5","this cake was just what i needed. not too sweet but moist and ummm yummy.. thanx a bunch my family's gonna love this too!!"
"1","4","I made this recipe as cupcakes last night and I think they are delicious. I added orange extract for flavour and my 4-year old wanted one before they were iced. They are light and fluffy and highly recommended. I don't know how anyone could go wrong with it. You could reduce the sugar a little if desired. It was so easy I made the mixture holding my toddler in one arm."
"1","5","Fabulous!! So simple. I sometimes add dried cranberries or currants or lemon flavoring. Adapts to everything."
"1","5","I made these for my son's class a few times, and they were great!!!"
"1","4","These were very easy to make and quick. They are very good, but need to be eaten the same day you bake them. They aren't very cakey or really very flavorful. But they did the trick and would be great if you needed something in a hurry."
"1","5","It was simply delicious!"
"1","5","I USED THIS RECIPE TO USE UP AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF APPLES. MY MOTHER USED TO MAKE AN 'APPLE CAKE' LIKE THIS BUT USED A 'ONE EGG CAKE'. THIS IS MUCH BETTER."
"1","4","fantstic for kids, easy and tasty! We added lemon to make a lemon cake!"
"0","5","I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and it was a total success. I added a little more milk and it was perfect. Tastes almost like a pound cake."
"0","5","I loved this cake. Came out very moist and spongy. My family loved it. I made it a second time and added coconut extract and grated coconut and it was a bigger hit than the first time."
"0","5","Great vanilla cake. I doubled the recipe for cupcakes, using the recommendation to include 2TB vanilla and 1.5 cups of milk. I beat the heck out of each step ( I didn't time it, but let them go at least 5 minutes for butter and sugar only and then a couple minutes each after each egg). Doubled, the recipe made enough for 36 good size cupcakes. Used a basic vanilla buttercream for icing. Children and adults raved at the party! Will definitely use this recipe again. *** made this again a week later. I beat the butter and sugar even longer this time and oh my goodness, delicious. The longer you beat it, the lighter and fluffier the cake becomes. This is truly a to-die-for recipe."
"0","2","I did not care for this recipe"
"0","5","This recipe is the BEST ! Its super easy & fast. I usually use more vanilla extract tho."
"0","4","I made cupcakes out of these. Though they were light and fluffy, I found them to be a pinch dry. Very few ingredients drew me to it. I can not afford a grocery of products for 1 item. I will tweak it and use it again. Thanks! :)"
"0","5","Love this cake. Not too sweet. I make it as is, bake it in a 9x9 pan and then put chopped nectarine on top. A big nectarine. Bake at 350 for 40 min. Love it."
"0","5","I make this all the time for my family. They just LOVE it"
"0","5","This cake is wonderful. I used it as my base cake for my Zinger Cake, inwhich you leave the cake in pan (preferably glass), pierce it with a wooden spoon handle, sprinkle with 1/4 cup lightly toasted coconut and douse with 3/4 strength disolved raspberry gelatin. Chill 2 hours. Frost with whipped topping. Sprinkle with coconut. PERFECT!"
"0","4","it was ok..but it was not what I was expecting. .it was a bit dry and too sweet but eh..i give it four stars cause I don't want to mess up its reputation. I followed the recipe exactly btw"
"0","2","2 stars Bc I don't think this recipe bakes up pretty at all. I have been professionally baking for years. It's also hard to get out of the pan. It's simple and simple ingredients so it is a good recipe to make cupcakes at home for, but that would be about it."
"0","4","I made this last night and I wasn't disappointed except I thought the batter was kinda thick!! Can someone tell me if adding more milk might make a difference? Help please."
"0","5","We love this cake! I have made it 5 or 6 times now! I also substituted flours and made 2 kick butt gluten free cakes! Its soooo yummy! I doubled the vanilla:)"
"0","5","This cake turned out sooo good. It is the first cake I have made from scratch that turned out moist. I read a lot of other reviews first (thank you!) and made a couple changes and I have a couple of tips. I had doubled the recipe to make a round layer cake, but I substituted in shortening for half of the butter. I beat the shortening, butter, and sugar for 10 minutes straight. I added each egg one at a time, and beat each of the eggs in for 2 minutes, and then an additional 2 after the vanilla. I used cake flour instead of all purpose and I sifted it twice with the baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt (remember its doubled). Finally, I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and did add a quarter cup extra (for the double recipe). This cake may give me diabetes, but it is moist and incredibly delicious!"
"0","5","I made this cake with Gluten Free Flour for a friend B-Day......IT WAS AMAZING!! I used a 'Cup by Cup' flour and I doubled the recipe and made it into a bunt cake... I would tell ANYONE with any cooking experience to make this cake! :)"
"0","1","I followed all the instructions, and the cake turned out pretty bad. It tasted like baking soda. :/"
"0","4","I didn't make any intentional changes, however I used cane sugar instead of white sugar and my daughter and I made a few swirls with food coloring. It came out a bubbling pan of liquid sugar. : ( Did I mess it up by using cane instead of white sugar? And I just realized my baking powder is expired, would that have effected it too? This was my first ever attempt at baking a cake from scratch and I'm eager to do it again as soon as I pick up more butter and the proper sugar, if that in fact was the issue.  Thanks for any feedback! : )"
"0","5","Only changes, I used margarine instead of butter and used 3/4 cup milk. Definitely beat the eggs very well. I then made a cream cheese frosting and I must say the moment I took a bite I fell in love! I will definitely make this again. So amazing!"
"0","5","Added double the amount of vanilla and used 18% cream instead of milk. Yum!!!!"
"0","5","First time in many years making cake, so I chose this one and paired it with a strawberry cream cheese frosting for my daughters bday tomorrow. It turned out perfect! Light and fluffy, and not heavy and dense. Great for the summer time on the hot days."
"0","3","Pretty good. I added a pinch of salt and instead of just 1/2 I added 1 1/4 milk to it. I was like the others very skeptical when it comes to following recipes from the net. This one I tried to bake because my family wanted to eat one. I red all the reviews first because, they mostly tell their experiences with making the finished product. I agreed to most of you as I have a small knowledge when it comes to baking cakes. I added some more ingredients like the salt."
"0","1","Horrible!! Taste like flour."
"0","5","I'd like to give it 4 1/2 stars. This is a very good recipe. The cupcakes were tasty and enjoyable. I would live it if they were a *bit* more moist, but that is the issue with white cake, isn't it? I used the modifications suggested by naples34102, plus a little extra vanilla (I LOVE vanilla). They were a hit with my 80-something dad, my husband and me, and my 5 year-old daughters."
"0","3","It was rough and hard."
"0","3","Good flavor. Taking advice of other reviewers, I added 1/8 cup extra milk and it fell in the middle. I mixed it well, not sure of the problem. I made it for fresh raspberries, so not a problem."
"0","2","it was really dry it was a good recipe, but the cakeist is superdry and gross."
"0","5","I once substituted eggs with bananas, an odd combination but still good! This is my favorite cake recipe and I love that its from scratch never using a box again!!! :)"
"0","5","Moist, tasty, quick and easy. The middle sunk but I'm at high altitude."
"0","4","I really like this recipe, it is very simple and you can use it with very little ingredients. I even have my daughter help, and she love to help me bake.I add an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and I have made this recipe. If you are craving a chocolate version of this, I add 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the milk, and warm it up and then add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the milk, kind of like you are making a hot cocoa. Then I add it to the cake batter. Comes out so yummy."
"0","5","This is the recipe I use when I need a basic white cake. I sub cake flour for the all-purpose flour."
"0","5","Made as directed and crumb was quite good for AP flour. 1 reviewer said there was no vanilla or salt and was plainly incorrect as to vanilla (2 tsp in recipe - any relation to Johnny Clegg of Savuka fame Connie ?) I'd tone down the vanilla to 1 dose (tsp) add a generous 1/8 tsp salt & maybe 1/4 c. less sugar ( if frosted this would have given me the sugar shakes) and when using AP flour the lack of moisture was correct. The corn starch/buttermilk suggestion would be OK if adding 1/4 c. b.milk & replacing some of the B. powder with 1/2 tsp B. soda to counter the acid of B.milk & the suggestion of using high ratio cake flour would throw this recipe and make it unbalanced as clearly the original author of this cake new what they were doing! 4.5 stars for my taste (too sweet & vanilla heavy). Thanks for a great base to work from !!!"
"0","5","I scraped out a vanilla bean pod and added the scrapings, and these were good."
"0","5","Thanks for sharing this recipe! It is easy to make with ingredients that are usually on hand, and clean up is simple. This is a great recipe when you want something quick to make that is not going to yield a big amount that you have trouble getting rid of before it goes stale - a very handy everyday recipe. I've made this just as written once. The next time I threw in some blueberries to see how the recipe adapts. I also used buttermilk, because I like baking with that when using blueberries so that their color stays bright. The recipe is a winner as is, but it's also flexible; next time I plan on trying some chopped cranberries and coconut. A sprinkle of sanding sugar on top before baking added interest, too."
"0","5","I loved this recipe but I made a few alterations. I subbed vanilla-flavored almond milk for the milk and because I didn't have enough vanilla extract, I ended up using only 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 a tsp of anise extract. The cake came out incredibly moist and the anise extract really added to the overall flavor, making it sweeter than what it would have originally been. It's already been requested as a birthday cake for a friend of mine!"
"0","3","i personally think its a great recipe except the need for little salt and i believe the sugar is a little less in my opinion. may be i do have a sweet tooth.."
"0","5","I followed the directions and got a reliable, basic white cake which was exactly what I was looking for. This would make a good base for cake variations, and also worked well for making a rainbow-swirl layer cake. It was reluctant to come out of the pans, so make sure to flour and butter them well."
"0","3","following Jillian's lead, I doubled the recipe, used 1 1/2 cups milk and 2 T vanilla. Seems very bland, even with the additional vanilla. Was okay, but not a keeper for me."
"0","5","I was skeptical about the ease of this recipe. I am used to more labor intensive cake recipes. I needed a quick recipe and this one is that. Well to my surprise this is an excellent and delicious cake recipe. Just as good if not better than those labor intensive recipes I was always baking. NO MORE!!! From now on this is my recipe for cake. Goes to show that sometimes the best things in life are simple."
"0","5","I made it n the cake z superb"
"0","5","My brother always makes this cake and I've never had a better cake. I can't describe it, so you should try it!"
"0","2","Not so good :( I doubled the recipe and made some mini cupcakes and used my Wilton 6'round-5 layer pan set. It was dry and kinda flavorless which is what I have found with every white cake recipe I find....I'll have to keep looking"
"0","5","This cake was sooo good, it almost tasted like as if it had glaze on it"
"0","3","I thought it lacked a little flavor. It was fine but seemed bland."
"0","5","this cake was so good! I had to make a cake for a party it needed a little more vanilla it was soft and moist"
"0","4","I've made this cake twice. The first time my family said it tasted like cornbread, the second time it was a little better. I'm following the instructions exactly, so I don't know why I can't get it right! I'm trying to learn to bake cakes, and this recipe seems simple enough."
"0","2","I don't know what I did wrong, but this cake did not turn out how I would've liked it… It was kind of dense and dry. I followed the recipe exactly. Not how I wanted my birthday cake to turn out. Kind of wish I used a box mix..."
"0","5","Delicious! Been making this recipe for YEARS, but finally rated it. I make this all the time as cupcakes and cake, if you make plain vanilla, I suggest putting 1 TB of raspberry/strawberry jam in the cupcake holders to add a yummy hint to it and I also use 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 to make the cupcakes nice and moist:) Thanks Scottosman for the awesome recipe!:)  EDIT: Have made this with Buttercream frosting and Grocery store style frosring. (both on allrecipes also)"
"0","3","It's frustrating because I made this cake 5 times, using butter, and everything and still not done in center, and out side is brown. Frustrating."
"0","5","Despite other reviews that indicated the cake was too dry, I wanted to try it anyway. It was a really good cake that was springy and fluffy! I'm not much of a baker, so even with my limited knowledge, it turned out pretty great. I had to add a few more splashes of milk (I used coconut milk because I never have regular milk in my fridge) because it was a touch dry. I also accidentally added 2 tablespoons of vanilla (oops) but it was great anyway. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.    I will also point out that I do not have a mixer, not even an electric hand mixer, so I did this all by hand with spatulas and whisks. When I was mixing the butter and sugar, it felt a bit hopeless because it didn't look like it would ever come together. But finally after 5 or 6 minutes or so, it started to look pasty so I kept going for a few more minutes. I used a hard spatula almost like a knife to cut through the butter and sugar and force it to come together. From there on out, I made sure each new item was well combined before moving on, no matter how long it took! It definitely paid off. Baked it for 35 minutes.    I made a simple whipped cream in my magic bullet for the cake and topped the whole thing off with halved strawberries. Yum! I'm definitely trying this one again in the future. Thanks for a great, basic recipe!"
"0","5","I made this simple white cake for Memorial day holiday,and made the bananas foster I from this site to pour over the cake. I added vanilla ice cream and topped it off with fresh cut strawberries and whipped cream. I followed the recipe as written except that I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground Tahitian vanilla bean to the cake batter. Next time, I'll try caramelized pineapple as a topping. Simply divine easy cake and extremely versatile! :D"
"0","5","omg, perfect! Better than any box cake. I did what the review with two stars said and added 2 tbs of corn starch to 1 cup of flour; 1 tbs for 1/2 cup and the 1/2 tsp of salt, that's all i change. DEVINE!"
"0","5","Made these in to cupcakes tonight for the first time and they were hit with my family. Followed the ingredients and directions as per recipe. Went to take a photo but there are none left. :o)"
"0","5","This makes a beautiful 6' double or triple layer cake. I have filled the middle with lemon curd, raspberry jam, and today am making a coconut cake filled with haupia (Hawaiian coconut pudding). Makes a perfect little birthday cake for a small party."
"0","5","Easy and tasty!"
"0","5","I made the cake for my son's birthday . Success !"
"0","5","baked it for the first time just now and it came out perfect. I did beat the butter and sugar for about 10min."
"0","1","This made a batch of cupcakes look absolutely depressing. They pulled away from the paper and sunk in the middle. They were dense and had a weird texture. Big disappointment."
"0","5","I made this cake for strawberry shortcake. It's so good!!! I did add more sugar but not too much."
"0","5","Absolutely FABULOUS! Great texture and flavour. The family LOVED it!!!"
"0","4","I made it fat free by using 3 egg whites and substituting the butter with a 1/2 cup of applesauce, it turned out excellent."
"0","5","I have made this cake several times. When we can't afford to buy something sweet at the store, we have the basic ingredients at home and it satisfies our sweet tooth."
"0","4","This was the recipe I used to make cup cakes and vanilla cake for the first time! I am rating 4 stars instead of 5 because though my batch came out delicious, it was because I ised some of the additions recommended in the comments, and not the unadulterated recipe posted.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk, and used 2 tbsp of vanilla extract. It took 20 minutes for a dozen cupcakes. I brought them to my boyfriends house for Easter and they were a hit! Everyone said they were the most moist cupcakes they'd had, and one person said they never like cupcakes because they're too bready and crumbly but they were surprised how good these were."
"0","5","This recipe is simple and perfect. I made cupcakes, and they came out rich and moist, and just the right density. They werent airy, but they certainly werent dense or cornbread like. Just cake-like. The one change I made was to sub in 1/2 cup cake flour for all-purpose. This is nearly the exact recipe for my favorite disappearing sugar cookie, and I think I just found my favorite cake recipe! Sweet and simple! Thank-you!"
"0","4","I used this recipe for a thick Easter cake and it turned out fairly well. My only addition to the mix was a teaspoon of salt. The taste was pleasant and it was very moist. My only issue is that I wish it had been a bit lighter and airier, like the sort of cake you'd get from a bakery, as that's what I was looking for. It was a bit dense, but still worked well enough for what I needed, and it still tasted pretty good."
"0","5","Make this recipe into cupcakes! So good:)"
"0","2","Tasted nice, from what I could get released from the pan. It was completely stuck... had to go with a box cake. :("
"0","5","This is honestly the best cake recipe ever! My family loves it! I cook it all the time for my family!"
"0","5","I loved this cake recipe as it is and it came out super moist and soft which is a must for me in cakes. I did add a little bit of milk as suggested but the recipe is still great as it is."
"0","5","I've been searching for years for a good white cake recipe. I love this one. It beats up nice and fluffy. I've made it twice, the first time with shortening and a cup of almond milk, the second time with butter and a cup of almond milk. Turned out great both times! It's so simple!"
"0","4","Very simple easy recipe! Tastes pretty good, all I did was substitute the butter for canola oil, turned out perfect, nice and moist :)"
"0","5","This is a very delicious cake. I made it twice. First time I made it exactly as directed however it was a bit dry. The second time I added 1/4 more cup milk and it was perfect. I really enjoy this. I will definately make it again."
"0","5","Very simple and few ingredients. I made cupcakes twice. The 2nd time was better, but maybe reduce rosewater by 1/8th, as it was a bit rosey. I did add 4+1/8 tsp rosewater and 1 t vanilla so it really tastes like 'rose'. I also added 1T applesauce and a bit more milk the 2nd time I made b/c I wanted it a bit more lighter. I will be hunting for another cupcake pan though b/c it could make more than 12."
"0","5","I tweaked this recipe slightly. I added 3 tablespoons of marachino juice and about a cup of diced maraschino cherries. I also added 1tsp of salt. I also made a cream cheese frosting with the maraschino cherry juice. YUMMY"
"0","5","My son requested a homemade ice cream cake and I used this recipe for the cake portion - i just finished prepping the batter (which I doubled for 2 9' layers) and its delicious! For the center i'm using cookie dough ice cream and topping it with homemade whipped cream frosting."
"0","5","This recipe was fantastic. I made cupcakes and they came out very moist and delicious. I wanted to test it out first because of some of the bad reviews I read, so I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup oil instead of the egg (I was out of eggs) and they turned out delicious. Got to use my silicone cupcake liners and baked them for 23 minutes. They came out perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's definitely one I will make again.   If they came out dry for anyone, you probably didn't cream the butter, sugar & eggs (in my case, oil) well enough. Can't skimp on that part!!!"
"0","5","My favorite cake recipe I've tried thus far! Remarkably easy (love the limited number of ingredients), very moist, dense but still somewhat light, and delicious. I'm glad I read reviews first. I wouldn't have realized what a small cake it would make (I'm not terribly observant), so I doubled it for my daughters' birthday. Everyone-- even the adults who are not big cake fans--raved about it! I coupled it with a simple buttercream frosting, but I think it would be fabulous with something lighter or with some tartness."
"0","5","I am really pleased the way mine turned out. I adjusted the recipe to make 6 cupcakes, and the flavor is wonderful, while the texture is biscuity on top, and soft and fluffy on the inside. I whipped up my own whipped cream and cut up some strawberries to make strawberry shortcakes. So good!!"
"0","5","I made this cake for my daughter's 16th Birthday and it was delicious! At first she wanted a green cake but at the last minute wanted a rainbow cake."
"0","5","I have tried using 2/3rd cup sugar instead of 1cup. Still sweet enough - probably can reduce further. I have tried a little less butter than 1/2 cup (around 1tbsp less) and it worked out just fine. Can add orange/lemon zest for added flavor."
"0","3","My this was easy but mine turned out a little more dense than fluffy?"
"0","5","Made some tiny changes and this turned out the best white cake I ever made. Love this recipe. Used 3 eggs instead of 2 and Increased sugar by 1/4 cup. Softest cake ever."
"0","5","This has to be the simplest and tastiest cake I have ever made"
"0","5","Delicious but I did double the amount of everything so I got extra xx thx a lot x"

"0","5","My hubbie and I tried this on today and we never read the reviews...I was reading them and I did alot of suggestions on here..and I didn't know until after...we tasted and it is good...it taste like any other white cake I've had in the past...this is my first attempt at a homemade cake and I got to use my new kitchen Aid mixer and that thrilled me...we made a chocolate whipped cream frosting to go on it and it is amazing...Thank you...MERRY CHRISTMAS"
"0","5","I was looking for an easy recipe for a light, fluffy white cake and this recipe was excellent. I followed other reviewers suggestions and made sure to fully beat the butter, sugar and eggs together until it was light and fluffy. Then I alternated adding the flour and milk (which I increased to 3/4 c), mixing until just combined. Do NOT overmix! The result was great. I made mini-cupcakes with them and they were a huge hit."
"0","4","I substituted almond for vanilla and it came out amazing!!"

"0","5","REALLY good white cake, turned out so well! Bonus that it's simple and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and made my son's first birthday cake with it (about a 4' round layer cake) as well as around 20 cupcakes. He really went to town on the cake so pretty sure he liked it, and the guests complimented the cupcakes as well. I used this (delicious) chocolate frosting recipe: Allrecipes Creamy Chocolate Frosting. Thanks for the recipe!"

"0","5","Thanks so much for the great recipe! I had to make cupcakes last minute and had hardly anything in the house. I doubled the recipe and got 28 delicious and moist cupcakes!"
"0","5","Made cupcakes they came out great!"
"0","2","I gave this cake two stars because it was fairly easy to make and was edible. Keep looking there are better recipes for cake."
"0","5","Like other reviewers, I added more milk. I used self rising flour and omitted baking soda/salt. By doubling the recipe I yielded one 9' cake and 12 cupcakes and about 10 Mini cupcakes. They all rose beautifully and were perfectly mild without being too sweet. I used a simple cream cheese frosting and left the mini ones unfrosted for the toddlers. The cake was even better the next day. Next time I'll make it and frost one day ahead of time."
"0","5","Best recipe ever .. its the easiest and most helpful thanks alot .. I use it alot I replace 2 tablespoons of flour for dark cocoa and get a chocolate cake, or I replace milk with any kind of juice and have the cake named by the juice :D I even used it as an upside down cake with pear and caramel (I reduced some sugar from the recipe and used it for the caramel).. I added some nuts and raisens and orange zest and it was amazing .. I do really thank you alot"
"0","4","I enjoyed this recipe with just a few changes: I added more vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt. What I really like is the versatility of this recipe. I've already vamped and revamped it several times. Makes a good base batter for just about any twist."
"0","3","I was pretty disappointed with this cake. Many of the reviewers said it was dense, so maybe I just don't like dense cake?!? I thought it was lacking in flavor and moisture. My mother owns a cake shop, so I guess I will stick to her recipe. It is much more moist."
"0","5","I made this tonight for my family and ate it with no icing, it was AMAZING! I will definitely make this again and again!"
"0","5","its a simple recipe- being a holistic nutritionist I wanted to give this a holistic flare and tried it with whole wheat flour, carob chips, coconut milk and kept everything else the same. DELICIOUS. try it out. Melissa Ziaei"
"0","5","Loved it! Made it last minute for a birthday and was a hit. Thank you so much!!"
"0","5","LOVE this recipe. However, I only get 8 cupcakes max from these ingredients when I make cupcakes. I like making big cupcakes, though."
"0","2","I made this for my son's birthday as he asked for a vanilla cake. I am not sure what went wrong as the cake was so crumbly and falling apart. I doubled recipe to make double layer cake and could barely handle the cake. I will not make again."
"0","5","My son has a dairy allergy and I've made this receipe several times substituting with vegan butter and coconut milk and it's delicious! Everyone who has tried it loves it. It's fluffy and ver flavorful. The perfect white cake!"
"0","5","So delicious! Increased milk to 3/4 cup as recommended by others. Unfortunately, I didn't grease my pan well enough so the cake fell apart when I tried to flip it. Turned the crumbles into a trifle with pudding and fruit to save it. At least this way I could sample the cake, and I will be making this again!"
"0","5","Tastes good, however, its not a white cake recipe, its yellow cake, and to make it a white cake, the yolks are to be removed from egg whites and thrown away."
"0","2","I just got done icing these cupcakes. I should have added extra milk like others suggested. They were very dry and dense but tasted alright. Won't use this recipe again."
"0","5","So simple, so easy, so delicious. I made cupcakes and chocolate frosting with this recipe, but plan on using this as a base for many other recipes."
"0","2",":( Came out extremely flat, not fluffy at all. Not sure why this was such a fail: I guess I didn't beat enough at each step! However, I will be trying this again."
"0","5","I made cupcakes out of this recipe and liked it very much. My whole family loved it. The problem with making any cake is not to overbeat it. When you add your flour and other ingredients and you keep beating it then the cake becomes tough and dry. When I make breads like pizza as well as sandwich bread I do not use a mixer but I do it by hand so as to get the feel of it because that too becomes dry and tough overmixing. This is a good cake and good for cupcakes. Thank you to the person who posted this recipe."
"0","3","I am reviewing this recipe as written with the caveat that I live at altitude. I make a recipe as written before I adjust for altitude. Some work and some do not. This one did not for cupcakes. That being said, the flavor was amazing...they really do taste just like sugar cookies. I am going to decrease the baking powder. I also think that this recipe makes more than 12 cupcakes. It's more like 15 regular cupcakes. I will make again with adjustments and suspect I'll love it and will change my rating."
"0","5","This is my go-to cake recipe. I bake gluten-free, so I sub out the flour with my gf blend and guar gum, and only use one egg when I want it a little fluffier. It's my favorite cake recipe; I've been using this one since I found it last year. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","This recipe is great! So simple and easy! I made cupcakes and filled the tin 1/2 full then put 2 fresh raspberries and filled it up the rest of the way. Everyone loved it!"
"0","4","It's ok. It came out a little dry. I've made it several times now and it's always the same...it's ok for cupcakes though."
"0","5","This recipe is awesome! I like to substitute the milk for warmed Arizona tea. Tastes awesome"
"0","5","Wow! I just made cupcakes using gluten-free flour (better batter) and they were amazing! Everyone loved them. I just added a little milk due to using the gluten-free flour."
"0","3","My only thing with this recipe was that the baking time was too long for me and my cake was 'over-baked'; Also add a little bit for water or milk to make it more moist!"
"0","5","This is my 'go to' vanilla cake recipe. So simple, moist, and delicious. I add lemon juice to tame the sweetness a bit-and I love lemon. The kids all over love this cake, and it's easy to make with them too."
"0","5","Awesome! Perfect white cake recipe!"
"0","4","Quick, easy and delicious!"
"0","3","Came out a little dryer than I was wanting."
"0","3","I must agree with most of the reviews I read that the taste is a little bland, even after adding an additional 3 teaspoons of almond extract. The texture was dense, but I actually used this recipe to test my new cake pop maker so perhaps it also has to do with that. After the first batch of cake pops (7 pops) was done I added 1/4 cup of dried coconut powder, 1 tsp of cononut extract, 1tsp cinnamon to the remaining batter and it was a mayor taste improvement. Like this the cake pops took much longer to cook though. FYI I got a total of 21 cake pops out of the whole recipe. I would use this recipe again using additional flavoring and spices."
"0","4","I tried this cake today and it turned out to be great.I added choco chips in the batter and it gave a different taste and look altogether. The ingredients are simple & a easy cake to bake for the beginners."
"0","3","I am always looking to try other cake recipes and This was a okay recipe for a 'white cake' To me it tasted to much like corn bread and the dense of the cake was a little on the drier side."
"0","5","I did what one reviewer said--to use 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1T vanilla, and to use cake flour, or make your own cake flour. I love the results! I used this recipe to make 6 mini-bundt cakes and it filled all 6 in the pan perfectly, with no cake batter left over. The cakes came out very light and fluffy with a great vanilla taste. I will definitely keep this recipe for all of my future cake endeavors.  To make your own cake flour, use 1 cup all purpose flour, remove 2T of it & put it back into your flour canister, then add 2T of corn starch. Sift 5 times."
"0","5","'That cake is killer,' is what hubs said, after eating about one fourth of it as blueberry shortcake. I made it exactly as prescribed in the recipe, with the one addition of 1/2 tsp. of salt. I also used salted butter. It is magnificent, really! Try it!"
"0","1","This cake fail to rise."
"0","5","This is a perfect cake to top with fresh berries and a simple frosting or whipped cream! Very moist and light, I may not need any other cake recipes!"
"0","5","Just made this cake its so good and very easy,Iput fruit at the bottom and the juices from the fruit went into the cake delish."
"0","5","OMG! THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! I made cupcakes a few days ago, but today I decided to put coffee creamer in the cake batter as a substitute for the milk and it came out soooo yummy! I would recommend this to everyone."
"0","5","Simple to make and taste great!"
"0","2","This is NOT a good recipe. It is dense as most the reviews stated, however, it doesn't not taste cake like at all. It is like a thicker slightly fluffier sugar cookie. Very disappointed. Made 3 batchs, all turned out the same. Though they had risen, they were too dense. Almost pound cake heavy. The sugar cookie taste was over powering"
"0","4","Simple, yummy."
"0","4","As nice as this cake is, its almost too sweet and too sugary. it is very heavy, like the pound cake you find in the frozen dessert section. if you are looking to sculpt a novelty cake and you want something that wont fall apart, then this is a good dense consistency for such a project."
"0","2","I made this cake and it was too DENSE! It was hard to cut through and filling. Would not make this recipe again."
"0","2","This cake is just ..ok..i wouldn't make it my go to white cake or cupcake recipe. For a traditional white cake i would maybe add 1 c. buttermilk instead of whole milk, salt and omit the egg yolks. With a little love this cake can be great!"
"0","5","Delicious and easy- my 12 yr old daughter made it! We used a little extra vanilla- about 3 tsp. And 1/4 cup milk + 1/4 cup plain Chobani greek yogurt instead of just milk. We couldn't wait long so we iced each warm piece with Cool Whip and sprinkled with semi-sweet chocolate chips! Amazing!"
"0","5","Great recipe! So versatile!"
"0","5","I made this tonight, and it was my first attempt at making a cake from scratch. It turned out awesome, and I'll definitely be making this one again!"
"0","2","The flavor is somewhat sweet and 'acceptable' but the texture is very dry. I'm definetely not making this cake again :("
"0","5","I made these cupcakes a while ago and they were delicious! I melted my butter until it was liquid and did everything by hand so it did take more work for me but was absolutely worth it!"
"0","2","Incredibly bland and DRASTICALLY needs salt."
"0","2","I made this recipe the first time, the cake ended up really dry and dense, (thinking it was my fault) I tried again in cupcake form, and same problem. I did not like it at all."
"0","5","Simply delicious and easy to make!"
"0","5","I have NEVER made a cake from scratch before...so when my husband's birthday rolled around I had forgotten to get a cake mix at the store. Then I found this recipe and tried it out (apprehension was getting the best of me) i hadn't noticed that it was for a 9x9 pan and ended up putting it ina 13x9 pan...oops:) it turned out womderful however...could be a bit fluffier in my opinion but i'd chaulk it up to not beating ingredients enough...my husband was soo impressed and actually said it reminded him of his Grandmother's baking(HUGE COMPLIMENT)...i'm defiantly keeping this in my recipe box. Thx for sharing"
"0","2","Too dense."
"0","1","It was tasteless and even with modifications turned out like cornbread. Won't try this one again"
"0","4","Easy to make and taste absolutely delicious"
"0","5","I made this for my birthday...Doubled the recipe...Filled the layers with lemon curd and just made a vanilla buttercream. The changes I made were to add 1/2 tsp of salt, a bit of almond extract to cake and frosting, and I also used evaporated milk instead of whole milk...which I increased by 1/4 cup total (so 1 1/4 cup). Very nice cake...dense in texture, rather than light and fluffy."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for all my occasions. Everyone loves the cupcakes I make!"
"0","5","Following all the advice on here, I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk and upped the vanilla to 1 tbsp, and made this into cupcakes--so delicious! They're a bit flat, but super moist, and taste richer and all around better than any boxed mix. I'm a convert!"
"0","5","This was my 1st time making this cake . For strawberry short cake .. I will never go back to box baked goods . It's so good from scratch"
"0","4","This was okay. Used the recipe to make mini cupcakes. I did increase the milk to 3/4 c, per other reviewers' suggestion. The mix was a little crumbly, rather than moist. Still tasted great, just not quite what I was after. Could have been operator error, as I had skim milk, rather than whole. Would try this again. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","This cake was my first 'from scratch' cake and it was absolutely AMAZING! My family loved it."
"0","5","great recipe!! added a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise to make it nice and moist and it turned out great!"
"0","5","I have made this recipe twice, once as a cake last night as cupcakes both times it turned out amazing.  I increased the milk to 3/4 of a cup after reading other comments and creamed the butter and sugar for around 10 minutes.  I will always use this recipe now for my cupcakes and next time I will try adding cocoa powder to make a chocolate version. I will report how it turns out."
"0","4","I love how simple this is! However the first time I tried it, the cake didn't have much body to it. So instead of a 1/2 cup milk I put 1/4 milk and a 1/4 sour cream. It came out so much better."
"0","5","Perfect for frosting or as strawberry shortcake. Made as stated but there are endless possibilities with this recipe."
"0","5","I did add more milk and vanilla as suggested by others. Also replaced 2tbls of flour per cup with corn starch to make it cake flour. Was soooo yummy will be my go to."
"0","5","I tried the recipe w/ the help of the most helpful critical review....w/ 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 cup almond milk & 1/4 cup of sweet vanilla creamer. It was the best vanilla cake I've ever had. I poked holes in it and poured a glaze over it using, 2TB butter, aapproximately 1 cup of confectioner sugar, half teaspoon of vanilla extract and about a teaspoon of water... yes water. It tasted like a lite twinky! Will try again but will make it a rum cake."
"0","5","I followed ingredients exactly and then added lavender to the batter. I also topped with homemade powdered sugar icing. This is a great 'canvas'cake for any kind of cake you would like to bake! I will use this again when make a rainbow cake or cupcakes"
"0","5","I made cupcakes with this recipe tonight, and although I always tweak recipes, and I did this one a bit, this is THE best vanilla cake ever. Try it and then try a box cake and you can actually taste an after taste with the box cake! I doubled the recipe so I could make 24 cupcakes, and I had enough batter to fill three miniature loaf pans as well. I increased the vanilla to 1 TBLSP (2 TB) and the milk to 3/4 C (1 1/2). This will be my white cake from now on. Now to find a frosting!"
"0","2","I made this for my sons birthday party and despite following all the directions it came out dry. I was really disappointed."
"0","5","This was my second tester cake and it turned out delicious! I used 3/4 c milk and baked in a 9' round for about 30 min."
"0","5","I doubled this recipe for a 13x10 baking dish. Used a one pound RUSSELL STOVERS chocolate bar mixed with milk for the icing !! Don't get ony of this cake on your face , because if you do, your tongue will beat you to death , trying to get to the cake !! Best cake recipe I have made so far !"
"0","5","Follow the recipe and don't let the bad reviews daunt you!!!! Just made this to a T and it came out wonderful! Take the time to do all the steps correctly and you'll be fine!!"
"0","4","Everyone loved it as mini muffins but the cake seemed a bit much, but the 1 person that doesn't like cake, He sure seemed to like this one :) for me I find it tastes like a sugar cookie."
"0","4","Was going to follow others' suggestions and use 2x the milk, but read the directions wrong and used the actual recipe amount. Cake ended up fine! Used a tad more vanilla than the recipe called for."
"0","5","Super easy and delicious. The key is to really beat the butter and sugar! I did it until it looked like thicker whipped cream. I made sure to mix it well with the eggs and dry ingredients. It really is the key to this cake. I followed the recipe with the added 1/4 of milk that readers suggested and it turned out perfect! I also used almond milk and the nutty flavor worked really well in it. (Can't drink milk)"
"0","5","With this recipe I never buy box cake, this is very simple and delicious. I have added additional ingredients such as chocolate chips, toffee bits, cocoa, YUM. Awesome recipe thanks."
"0","5","I use this recipe for all my cakes and cupcakes. It's perfect to add whatever flavor to. I love it."
"0","5","STUNNING! This was my first time ever making a cake and little did I know that I would produce an ANGEL (cake)! but not an angel food cake, LOL. really though, incredible, so simple and no icing needed, because of the FLUFFY TEXTURE! I wish there was a 12 star rating!"
"0","5","This is my go to white cake recipe. It's fairly simple to make and easy to whip up if you're in a hurry. However I do make some substitutions. Instead of white sugar I use an equal amount of caster sugar and instead of using all purpose flour I use cake flour. To ensure a cake like consistency and not wind up with a cornbread like cake (some other reviewers had this problem) you must beat each step until the ingredients are creamy (without bumps). All in all a great recipe :)"
"0","5","It turns out perfect every time! Very nice simple cake and quite easy to make. Love it1"
"0","5","Simple and tasty :)"
"0","5","This is the best cake ever. PERIOD!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe!!! For this I used 2tsp. of almond extract vs vanilla and I added a splash of canola oil to my milk. Also followed the suggestion of adding 1/2 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients. I'll be using this recipe from now on. No more boxed cake mix for me! Thank you for a great recipe!"
"0","5","I love using this recipe. It has a great and even flavor, great with an accompaniment topping(icing, fruits, whipped cream...). I like using this recipe as my base and then add things into it(fruits, chocolate chips, SPRINKLES:)....). Its a good solid basic white cake recipe."
"0","5","I made this for my husbands birthday and I will be going back to this recipe again and again. I doubled the recipe to make a layer cake and subbed in butter milk in place of regular milk. I made a butter cream frosting put raspberry filling in the middle. The key I think is mixing it very well. I heard the word 'best cake I've ever had' being said. Next time trying a lemon curd filling with coconut topping yummm!"
"0","5","I tried this recipe last night and despite having to add a little more liquid to the mix,about a 1/4 Cup of water instead of milk,because the mixture was somehow dry,the results were an amazing and delicious cake. I'll definitely do this again."
"0","1","So, I also did not pay mind to the negative reviews of this cake. Sadly, I should have.  I am not a novice cook and just about everything I've ever made from this site has come out great. This is the first time I've felt the need to give a negative review.   I made cupcakes with this recipe. As others have said, it has a very dense, corn-bread like texture. It is not sweet at all; in fact, it has almost no flavor whatsoever. And the cupcake tops had hardened so much after just cooling enough to frost that tapping the tops with a knife was audible!  The chocolate frosting (my own recipe) I used was delicious but sadly did nothing to help the cake portion of the cupcakes. If you are looking for a flavorful, moist, delicious white cake, skip this recipe and keep looking."
"0","1","This is the strangest cake I've ever made or tasted. Erasing this from my recipe box."
"0","5","This was a very simple recipe and tasty, the first time I made it I used a cream cheese frosting. The people I made it for had it eaten in a day and a half. They loved it so much I made 2 more the following week. They said it was the best cake I had every made, it was so fluffy and moist."
"0","5","Awesome recipe..... I was never good at cakes and always thought dat I cant make good cakes but dis cake was so yummy, soft and delecious.... I topped it with ur buttercream froasting n my whole family loved the cake.."
"0","1","It does taste like a sugar cookie and not in a good way. Too dense and flavor is off."
"0","3","This was good but pretty bland."
"0","5","Love this recipe! I made my son's birthday cake (1/2 sheet, triple the recipe) and cupcakes using this and it was much simpler than the recipe by Martha Stewart, plus if you add just 1/4 cup more milk, the cake is fluffier. Will definitely be using this from now on."
"0","2","I pinned this and made it today with my daughter. It's edible and has a good flavor, but soooo dry! I'm a little surprised by the great reviews. I won't be making it again."
"0","5","This is the best cake ever! I have made it several times, each time changing something a little bit. I have used vanilla, orange, almond, and coffee extracts (on separate occasions, not mixed together!), and they were all delicious. I have also used soy milk and added chocolate chips, and those both turned out well, also! One thing I have noticed it the cake is a little fluffier if the sugar and butter is beat together for quite a while. In any case, I will be making it again for sure!"
"0","5","Wonderful"
"0","5","So simple to make. My first try at a homemade cake since i was a teen (disaterous result), moist and delicious."
"0","5","JUST MADE IT THE KIDS O MYYYY LOVE IT. FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY AND IT WILL COME OUT GREATTTT"
"0","1","it was my moms birthday and i was gonna make her a cake, my first ever cake. i was really excited to do something special for her. i buttered the pans SO WELL and even used parchment paper just to be on the safe side, it cooled for half the day. when it was finally done, it collapsed in the pan. i have to find the pieces and put it together like a frickin puzzle.   it was cornbread. it was literally. corn bread. with whipped cream. and jam."
"0","5","I really liked this recipe the cake was really soft and delicious, i added 1/2 teaspoon more of baking powder and also 1 more teaspoon of vanilla. I added 1/2 cup of sweet dried cranberries and 1/2 cup fresh cranberries, but makes sure you put some flour on the cranberries before adding them into the mix so that they don't settle down at the bottom of the cake."
"0","5","This is my first time making a cake from scratch and I am so happy I chose this recipe to explore with. I read the reviews, as I always do before I dive into a new recipe and I do understand the cornbread-like texture everyone was talking about. Mine was caused by two things: being that I placed the batter into (2) 9-inch round pans, it was really thin, which lead to my second issue, the bottom being overcooked. It wasn't bad, just slightly off putting. I have learned from it, however. I will still continue to make them as I just did, thinly, because I want to make more batter and create a six layer rainbow cake (I am so excited for that)! I think I will play with the temperature next time, perhaps lowering it to 325 degrees. Thank you for this recipe scottosman, I will be using this recipe time and time again. :)"
"0","5","Jan.18th 2014. Good old recipe, just as my Mom use to make. Thanks you HannahLaura"
"0","5","This cake was amazing - I could not stop eating the batter before it even reached the oven!! But I did make some changes in the recipe: 1) I used raw (brown) sugar 2) I added about 2C of Chocolate Chips - and it tasted amazing!! My whole family couldn't get enough of it and now I'm making my second batch since the first has gone in a matter of days!!  Although I recommend that if you add Chocolate Chips into the cake mix, then make it more thick with flour because the chocolate chips will start to sink to the bottom and can get stuck to the pan and your cake can crumble - and even if it does then its okay- just make cake pops!! Yummy!!"
"0","4","Delicious! We made it in the Twos class and the kids LOVED it!"
"0","2","My boyfriend liked them okay, but I thought they tasted like cornbread. Will NEVER make again."
"0","5","Amazing and so easy. It was huge hit tonight at a family dinner tonight."
"0","5","Made this for a baby shower and everyone raved about it! Not overly sweet, not too dense and but kept together nicely without crumbling. I topped with my own buttercreme frosting. I needed two 9x13' layers so I made 1 1/2 of the recipe and after 30 minutes in my oven it was perfect. The only thing I changed was to add about extra 1/4 cup milk because I thought the batter was too thick. I was so proud of this cake!"
"0","5","Instead of vanilla extract, I added lemon! Turned out Fabulous!!!"
"0","5","I really love this one! I followed directions and made in loaf pan topped with chocolate glaze and I want the whole thing to myself. I think it was dense for some people because it wasn't mixed long enough. I agree with one review that it should look like cool whip that's how you know it will be light! Only a dash extra of milk. This is a great small portion recipe for a quick after dinner dessert!"
"0","2","It is to dense for my liking I mean it was good but I don't think I'll make it again :/"
"0","5","fabulous! Tried it today. nice and soft cake. I also added some sultanas with it. really great!"
"0","5","I had no problems with baking when using this recipe. Absolutely loved the cake. This is a quick and simple good cake recipe that is moist and delicious. I wanted to find a cake recipe I could use to make a lemonade cake for my daughters recipe. I had two that I picked to use and didn't even try the other one because this one had me at first bite. First, I made the cake by itself and it didn't last in my house more then 20 minutes. The kids tore it up. Then I doubled up the recipe while adding a lemon pudding mix to the ingredients. After that came the lemonade and sugar mixture. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
"0","2","Disappointed. I followed the recipe but also made some of the changes suggested (added the extra 1/4 cup milk, and extra vanilla extract) and I made sure to beat the mixture between adding everything etc. However, my cupcakes turned out dense (which I wouldn't mind as long as they tasted yummy), however, they tasted like pancakes!!! That was the first thing to pop in my head! I am hoping I can salvage them with some homemade buttercream frosting."
"0","5","Really excellent recipe.quick put together .try with an 8 by 8 pan ,cook a little longer.great snack cake"
"0","1","Made the cake as directed and it was not good at all. It did not rise at all and it was really dry and dense. Will not make again."
"0","5","Great recipe! Made cake in bundt pan, cooked @ 325F between 40-45 minutes came out excellent. Thanks for sharing recipe ;-)"
"0","5","Tasted like a sugar cookie but in a cake! My go to white cake recipe!"
"0","5","I mixed a batch for 96 cupcakes all at once. The color, texture, flavor and taste is simply amazing. I however added 1/8 cup of water for every 12 tray serving. This is the best cupcake recipe I've come across! Definitely a keeper"
"0","5","I don't like sugar cookies, but I loved these. I doubled the recipe, used 4 tsp of vanilla, 1 1/2 C of milk, 2tblsp of cornstarch in each cup of all purpose flour, and made sure I whipped each egg well. The batter was tasty too. For my son's party I swirled in a drop of food coloring in each one before baking. I made 18 cupcakes and these took 30 min to bake. Heavenly with butter cream frosting."
"0","5","This was the first homemade cake I ever made. It was simple quick and delicious! I did add 1 Cup milk although it could easily take 1 1/2 Cups milk which I will add next time. My family and I ate the whole thing in two days. I'm making this recipe again."
"0","5","Very simple make. I used it for cupcakes and they were delicious."
"0","5","will make it again it was so easy"
"0","5","I am eleven and I love to bake. This is the best cake I've ever made! It was a birthday cake for my four year old brother. Every body lived it! My aunt, who is intolerant to glutamate, took three servings. I doubled it and made a two layer cake with fondant and I plan on doing it again considering all the complements I got from my relatives."
"0","5","Tried it today absolutely loved it hands down best and easy cake recipe I have ever tried"
"0","4","was a good cake"
"0","5","This is the dream cake I have been looking for. So easy to make, dense but not doughy, moist not crumbly, lightly vanilla flavoured and just the right sweetness. I followed the recipe to the letter. Didn't really know how long to mix but I ended up mixing on medium setting for about 2 minutes. I resisted the temptation to add a bit more milk when the batter turned out very thick and needed spreading in the pan. I used this recipe for a version of a Pineapple Upside Down cake. Into a 9' round cake pan I poured melted 1/2 cup of butter and mixed in 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and smoothed it around the pan. Then I arranged 7 pineapple rings from a can on top of this mixture beginning in the middle of the pan. Over this I scooped and spread smooth the White Cake batter and baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Made this twice and it was delicious."
"0","5","I thought it was great. I followed the recipe exactly, I just wanted something easy to make. My husband and I both really liked it."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. Very simple to make. When I followed the recipe exactly, it was a little dry to me. I added 1/4 block of cream cheese soften to the sugar/ butter mixture and a little more milk. Turned out very moist.-Ruby"
"0","1","This recipe is awful. I followed the instructions exactly and I came out with pancake tasting cupcakes!"
"0","4","This is a 5 star recipe with the modifications given by many reviewers (4 star as is). It's really hard to find a good vanilla cake recipe and this is the best I've found after trying several. Yummy and light! Not a true white cake though. Use 1 T of vanilla extract (I used vanilla bean paste for appearance) 3/4 cup of buttermilk Cream butter and sugar for 10 minutes."
"0","5","Had An Amazing Time Making This Simple To Prepare Cake With My Children! Great Recipe And Delicious Outcome :) Highly Recommend, I Had It Done, Iced And Ready For Pudding By The Time Dinner Had Been Eaten!"

"0","5","I used this recipe and made chocolate chip muffins with it and they turned out great my daughter and son loved them and can't wait to make them again :)"
"0","4","Came out a little dense but it tasted great!"
"0","5","This has just become my 'go to' white cake recipe."
"0","5","I've tested this recipe, stuck to it, and loved it! It was a little bit dense but overall tasted and looked amazing. I'd try adding 1/4 cup more of milk the next time, after reading the reviews. My whole family loved this cake!"
"0","5","Just used this recipe for cake pops and is perfect! The food coloring was very vibrant due to the lack of color in the cake. Consistency was perfect for spooning into the teeny little molds!"
"0","4","These are amazing cupcakes :D I am having a movie night and having a home cooked meal for my friends. We're having homemade chili and rolls and for desert cupcakes. Though if you want actual all white cupcakes, use the eggs, but keep the yolks out. I forget every time I go to make white cake and get yellow instead and usually realize the mistake right at the second turn of the spoon."
"0","5","I used this recipe for a first attempt at baking and it was AMAZING! Definitely will use this again. It makes the simplest, most delicious cake I have eaten, with or without frosting!"
"0","5","Jillian said REALLY DOES taste like a sugar cookie! i forgot to add extra milk an it was still yummy! i doubled the batch an used a full sized glass cake pan (10x13?). at 30min edges OBVIOUSLY done but middle still uncooked. it did spring back to touch but looked liquidy an jiggly underneath so i did full 40min. top was VERY firm so i worried it be dry but it was yummy still! love love love this recipe!!"
"0","5","Yes loved it !"
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe. It tastes like sugar cookies but in cake form. It is my go to cake recipe now. I also used the slight changes that one person did. I doubled it and used 2 tb of vanilla (REAL vanilla) and 1 1/2 c. of milk. It turns out amazing everytime"
"0","5","I have used this recipe a few times, I love it. I make it with white spelt flour (I have a wheat intolerance), skimmed milk and use a hand whisk to get it light and fluffy. I also add a little extra vanilla"
"0","5","I love this cake. It's moist and tasty and easy to decorate for kids birthday cakes. Everyone loves it!"
"0","5","Great recipe I love it! :)"
"0","5","Love this recipe just wish I could make it a little less dense and more fluffy. Would substituting some of the better or shortening help with that?"
"0","5","Love it came out great!!1"
"0","2","I tried out this cake recipe and yes it was very easy to make but it did not rise and the texture was very chewy and I did not really like it but I still will use allrecipes.com it is a great website plus that is the first time I have made something from allrecipes.com and it actually turned out bad but hopefully this is the last time it happens."
"0","5","This is the BEST most GREATEST white cake recipe ever! This is my go to recipe. Ive made this too many times to count. What other recipe is going to let you know its done just by it springing back to touch. Look no further you found the #1 White Cake Recipe! That's what it should be called."
"0","1","I thought the cake was too thick in your mouth. Followed the reviews and added more vanilla and milk. Disappointed"
"0","5","This was great recipe..we love this and we enjoyed eating this..so yummy and I recommend you also to try it.."
"0","5","Really easy & delicious. It was dense, but moist. I used coconut oil instead of butter & Splenda instead of sugar. Tasted great!"
"0","4","very moist and tasty"
"0","5","This makes an excellent birthday cake!!!!!"
"0","3","I just made it and hoping it turns out good :)"
"0","4","Made this recipe exactly as directed and it turned out pretty good. A little dense, but hearty and sweet enough that I ate it plain with coffee. After a day, though, the top lost some of its texture. It went a little spongy and sticky. But it was super easy to make and I would definitely make it again."
"0","5","it was really easy i would also use a bit more milk then they tell you but make sure you don't add too much. this recipe is great with chocolate icing in the middle i think so..."
"0","3","I doubled this recipe to make cupcakes for my dad's birthday but they came out a little too sweet."
"0","3","The consistency was good but it was very bland and not very exciting."
"0","2","I did this as cupcakes. They were tasteless and too dense. Blah. Gave it two stars instead of only one because they were not dry."
"0","5","I loved this quick white cake recipe, I took it and tweaked it a little. I fast boiled some grapefruit and thickened it up with some sour cream, than I added to the cake mix. YUM YUM. I'm calling it Bitter batter cake."
"0","4","I made this and followed all the measurements exactly. I doubled the recipe. Unfortunately, I don't have a mixer so I mixed it all by hand. And I didn't have an appropriate sized cake pan so I used a ceramic pie plate. I had to cook it a lot longer because of that. We coloured it and made gorgeous swirly layers! It's beautiful and tasty but mine turned out a bit dry. I don't know if the colours would hold if I added more milk. I'm practicing for my daughters bday an will definitely use this again. :)"
"0","5","This came out so perfect for me. I used the recipe precisely, it came out fluffy and delicious. It hadn't even cooled yet, I went into the kitchen and it was already half gone! My husband can't keep his hands off of it."
"0","5","beat the butter for 5 minutes then add sugar and beat again, add eggs beat then alternate milk/cream and flour."
"0","2","I substituted the buttermilk for the regular milk and I added just 1/2 teaspoon of salt. When I made this cake I expected it to be moist, rich, and delicious. I was suprised when after i frosted this cake and i tried it, it was very dry and didnt have a good texture. I do not plan on trying this recipe again."
"0","4","This recipe is super easy and tastes great!"
"0","5","i doubled the batter and made pineapple upside down cake with it"
"0","2","I was really excited to make this super simple cake. I was planning to make a cute little cake for my boyfriend, because I think random cake is yum. I was at the point where i had everything together in one bowl and I was adding milk till' smooth. But the thing is, is that it never got smooth. No matter how long I was beating it. I thought passed it and went ahead and greased up a pan and put it in the oven waiting for the results. After 30 minutes I checked on the cake with a toothpick and it seemed done. I took it out let it cool and took a tiny bite (since I was using cookie cutters to make mini cakes) and it tasted like a dull sugar cookie. Not only that, but about 10 minutes later my stomach was upset and I ended up having diarrhea. So, if you are wondering if this is a good choice for a simple cake, I would just tell you to find something else. It's pretty sad."
"0","5","I have made many cake recipes, and this one is my favorite, very easy."
"0","3","I just made this recipe today and I doubled it. The taste was great however it's really dry. I need to figure out what more to add to make it moist."
"0","5","Love this recipe! I use this as my go to recipe for anything white-cake related (strawberry shortcake, birthday cupcakes, etc). I base this review on only making it as cupcakes thus far. Also, over time, I learned that replacing 1/2 tsp of the vanilla extract with almond extract (so there are some of both extracts) makes them better!"
"0","5","This has become my standard recipe for cupcakes and all other cakes. For a chocolate version I substitute half cup of flour for half cup of cocoa and guess what... Still tastes great especially with cupcakes! Just love it!"
"0","4","This was a good cake. The texture is dense not fluffy."
"0","3","I must have done something wrong but as far as i know i went by the recipe to a T aaaand they weren't that great.. Granted I made cupcakes instead of a cake, but that shouldn't have effected it.. My batch ended up tasting like a bitter pancake.."
"0","5","awesome recipe. I made it last night. I did as other reviews suggested and beat the sugar and butter for 8 mins. and then 5 mins. after each egg. also I sifted flour and baking powder and then alternated the flour and milk, also I (as suggested by others) increased the milk from 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup. it turned out moist and delish. it did taste like the perfect sugar cookie/cake not dense or crumbly. it makes a small cake as mentioned but can be doubled to make the perfect layered cake"
"0","5","I Love it thank you so much, I did added some powder chocolate nesquik and 2 spoon full of Mayonnaise to make it more fluffy. Other than that I love the recipe. :-)."
"0","4","I love this recipe. I have found that the outside has a tendency to get over done before the inside if fully baked. Turning the temperature down to 325, or even 300, takes care of the problem. This does increase the bake time. I use this recipe for large camp crowds."
"0","1","I am sad that my very first review has to be so negative. First off, the directions are terrible and out of order. I followed as best I could, and ended up with uneatable and bland crumbs. I couldn't get it out of my greased pan. I was left with nothing but crumbs. What a waste of ingredients."
"0","5","I added a little extra milk, per the previous reviews. This is the best white cake I have made yet, very light and fluffy."
"0","5","Very tasty"
"0","3","I liked the cake but i thought it was a little bit too dense.I made a blackberry frosting with it and that added a lot of flavor.The frosting was 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 cup of soft butter, 3 tablespoons of blackberry jam ( or any jam that you like) ,1 tablespoon of lemon juice (to bring out the flavor) ,and 2 table spoons of cream cheese."
"0","4","I made this cake a while back and I was highly nervous because I had never made cake from scratch before. I made a big mess HAHA but this turned out soooo goooood! Wedding cake texture but moist. I added almond extract AND vanilla, I didnt even measure it I just poured to my liking, so I ended up with a mostly almond flavored cake with a hint of vanilla. I am making it again today!"
"0","4","this is an awesome cake! perfect for birthday parties!"
"0","5","This is an easy recipe! I have seen the negative reviews on this but had to laugh because they stated the recipe had no vanilla extract umm maybe if you read the directions carefully you would see that there is indeed vanilla extract. This cake is very moist and I happened to use it for a Jello poke cake which turned out fabulous! To make it a true white cake I used egg whites and a litte bit more milk. I also doubled the recipe for a bigger cake."
"0","5","Excellent! Lovely aroma, flavor, yummy! I made it with Crisco butter flavored and added blueberries, baked in a Bundt pan for 40 minutes. Heavenly!"
"0","2","i made this recipe twice. Both times I used 3/4 cup of milk instead of half, I creamed the butter and sugar until fluffy, kept beating it while adding one egg at a time and combining well after each, beat more while I added the vanilla and while I added the dry ingredient mix a small bit at a time, then added the milk a bit at a time... I whipped it all until it resembled yellow cool whip, and it still came out dense, heavy, and cornbread-like, also a bit too sweet. One of them crumbled into pieces when I tried to turn it out of the cake pan. Will be using a different recipe from now on..."
"0","3","I read all the reviews and chose this cake for a big fondant covered cake project. Adjustments I made were using cake flour and ultra fine sugar, using buttermilk (adding an extra 1/4 c to ensure it was moist enough). I beat the sugar and butter for a very long time and carefully added the eggs and other ingredients just as instructed. The final product was 'meh'. Pretty dense and not the greatest crumb. Even with paying close attention to it in the oven, I felt it was drier than I wanted - and I took it out just at the minute it should've been done (toothpick test). May be good for cupcakes, but I would not make it again for a bigger cake."
"0","5","it taste awesome"
"0","5","This turned out soft, fluffy and absolutely yummy. I can't believe how simple it is to make"
"0","5","This was fantastic. I added a little extra milk and was surprised that it made more than a dozen cupcakes - I made fourteen, but half of them were HUGE so it could easily do a dozen and half if you want lower cupcakes with more room on top for frosting. I tried one hot out of the oven and was floored by the delicious sugar cookie crustiness on top of the cupcake. These are truly delicious in the simplest of ways and also make a great base for other mix-ins - I threw sprinkes in some, chocolate chips in others, and made a few with cajeta."
"0","5","THIS WAS THE EASIEST AND ALSO MOST DELICIOUS CAKE RECIPE I HAVE TRIED FOR A WHITE CAKE I DO A LOT OF BAKING AND BY FAR THE BEST I BAKED IT IN AN 8 INCH ROUND PAN AND IT ROSE TO THE POINT THAT I COULD CUT IT IN HALF AND MAKE IT A DOUBLE LAYER THANK YOU FOR SUBMITTING THIS RECIPE"
"0","5","I have made this recipe many times and each time everyone who tries it says they are awesome!!! This is definitely my go-to vanilla cake/cupcake recipe"
"0","5","I LOVE this recipe ! It's easy and simple to make ! It's perfect for a dessert and not to dry , I defiantly recommend this !!!:)"
"0","5","Used this recipe for my daughters first birthday cake and it was a success!!! I followed the recipe as is and received tons of compliments. Will be using it again and again!"
"0","2","Man... It turned out like cornbread, even with adding more milk. I ended up getting a boxed cake mix and modified the box mix from there to save money and time. I live at a higher elevation in Las Vegas, NV where humidity levels are consistently under 10%. If you live in the Southwest region, I wouldn't recommend this recipe. If I was back in Texas, it'd definitely turn out great i'm sure."
"0","5","I just took this out of the pan. I think it turned out great! Very spongy & light, tastes good. Not terribly sweet but flavorful. I used 1 TBSP vanilla and used 1c buttermilk like some of the reviews suggested."
"0","1","I followed all of the reviewers suggestions beat the cake batter every step of the way as well as adding extra milk. This cake was too thin as well as inedible. Definitely not worth all of the work this recipe entails."
"0","1","I had some high hopes for this one, but it fell flat...literally. This was like a pancake, in taste and texture. I'm glad I'm the only one that had to taste this."
"0","5","love it !!!!!!! Wait i haven't tried yet but i'm about to try it now so wish me luck! So its gonna be 5 stars until i make it"
"0","4","I swapped out the flour with 1 cup and 2 tbsp's of whole wheat flour, and it turned out pretty good, had almost a nutty taste. The cupackes didn't make it to see the next day.."
"0","4","I liked it! I did it just as the instructions read the only thing I added were cinnamon and walnuts. I did them as cupcakes and they were moist and yummy! :)"
"0","5","Love this cake mix make it all the time for my sons birthdays it's sweet and a little heavier for cake stacking."
"0","5","Loved it! This cake was light and fluffy and just delicious! We made a homemade chocolate frosting for the top! Delicious!"
"0","4","I liked it. It was a tiny bit dry and dense but it works out fine! I like adding a little bit more milk and a little bit less flour just remember not too much milk or the texture is weird. It tasted the best with butter cream frosting. Over all I like this recipe!"
"0","2","I've made three cakes using this recipe and I'm having terrible luck with it. The cakes (all 3) taste sour and of baking powder. I added up to a whole extra cup of sugar and still a taste of too much baking powder."
"0","5","This cake was a huge hit with my family. Surprisenly, I personally found it not sweet enough, but everyone else loved it. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is added vanilla pudding mix because I needed it to be a bit more dense to hold it's shape as a 3D Bear cake.   I'll be making this again and will probably add fruit of some sort - baked in the center of cupcakes or somethings.  Thanks for the recipe! :)"
"0","5","Just made this cake & it turned out really good - no need to icing these cupcakes. Moist with a good flavor. I did follow recommendations to beat the wet ingredients really well, to add xtra milk, & to add xtra vanilla. I also added food coloring (swirling thru each cupcake)- for the kids. Definetely a keeper!"
"0","5","I just made this cake and it was wonderful. I followed other reviewers advice and used 3/4 cup milk, creamed the butter and sugar very well and also added a lil extra vanilla. I also loved that it only called for 2 eggs. The cake was moist and fluffy. So YUMMY! I will definitely make this cake again."
"0","5","I LOVED this recipe! I substituted 1/4 of the margarine for shortening, added a pinch of salt, and substituted the regular milk for almond milk. The batter's texture was a little strange and thicker than I thought it should be, but the cupcakes turned out amazingly! They were light and fluffy, and moist on the inside. Absolutely delicious! (:"
"0","5","Really great and easy basic white cake. Thanks for posting!"
"0","5","Finding this recipe made me so very happy. I'd forgotten what a good 'plain' cake recipe can do. Batter can carry cocoa powder or lime zest or raisins or shredded coconut or crushed pineapple or a spice mix. Or fill the cupcake liners half way and drop in some cookie dough, a dollop of apple sauce, or a chocolate kiss before topping off with the rest of the batter."
"0","5","Very tasty. Not sweet like box cake. A good frosting gives it just the right balance."
"0","5","Delicious! Added some crushed pineapple and blue food coloring(for the boys) and topped it off with whipped cream! Yummy, my whole family loved it-easy to make and uses ingredients that are always on hand! Definitely try this recipe, easy enough to let the kiddos help."
"0","5","I made cupcakes with this recipe-they were AWESOME! I did do a bit of tweaking...after reading several reviews,I opted to use light olive oil(helped keep it moist),& then used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk(for richness),& a tsp of vanilla...it really helps to have all ingredients at room temperature,as well.Since box cake mixes have so much in them,it is a real pleasure to find a recipe so simple,& so delicious!"
"0","5","Made this today for my room mates, added some home-made Vanilla icing and crushed lollipops to make it pretty and playful! Great recipe easy to follow thanks for sharing :)"
"0","4","Best cake l have ever baked its simple"
"0","5","I needed a recipe for my bunny cake for Easter and this was wonderful! The only change I mage was substituded coconut milk for reg. milk because I was using coconut frosting. The cake was so moist and tender!"
"0","5","I doubled this recipe to make cupcakes and they came out beautifully!"
"0","5","This recipes was incredible. I made it for my sons Birthday with a cherry flavored cream cheese frosting. Delicious. Moist fluffy and so flavorful. Just make sure you beat your eggs till they look like yellow whipped cream."
"0","5","super easy and I doubled it for cupcakes fro friends and family!"
"0","5","I am a new at baking and this cake was a hit for me and I was able to surprise my family they loved it."
"0","3","Unlike those who had dry cake/cupcakes, mine turned out moist. But pretty sticky. no amount of oil and flour in the pan could keep this from sticking. Plus all the baking powder in it caused it to expand like mad but shrink to nothing when its done so it just got really messy. It tastes really good, it just didn't come out looking even remotely pretty."
"0","5","Perfect. I followed the instructions of others and added an exter 1/4 of milk and whipped the butter and sugare together of few minutes and then whipped it again for another 5 minutes or so with the eggs. I added chocolate sprinkles to the batter to get the 'confetti' look. This will be my go to basic recipe. I imagine you could add pudding mix to it and turn it to whatever flavor you want. Thanks for the recipe."
"0","2","I made cupcakes with this recipie it was simple and the flavor was there, but it was too dry. Unfortunately I iwill not be using it agaon."
"0","4","I tried this after trying a taste of home recipe that ended up tasting like cornbread. After reading some reviews I saw that no-one has mentioned that this is not a white cake. White cakes use egg whites. I used three egg whites in place of the 2 eggs. Other than that I followed it exactly."
"0","4","I'm a new baker and really enjoyed this cake (and it's simplicity!). I doubled the batch and used two teaspoons of vanilla along with about 1 1/4 cups milk (Next time I'll use 1 1/2 like a previous poster). I almost am going to feel guilty when I crumble it and turn it into cake balls! I'm pinning this recipe and will certainly use it again."
"0","5","My family and guests LOVED this cake! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. The cake turned out pretty dense - not sure if I did something wrong. But it was still absolutely delicious. Much better than a cake mix in my opinion!"
"0","5","This recipe is AMAZING thank you so much!"
"0","5","This was good, the first time I made this it was very dry. But the second and third time it was very good. The changes I made were, I added half shortning and half buttter then creamed both with the sugar for a couple minutes. I thought it was pretty cool. :)"
"0","5","I like it"
"0","5","I made this recipe with white whole wheat flour, soy milk, and olive oil (I didn't have canola) instead of butter. I also added chocolate chips and made cupcakes with it. My husband said it was the best cake I've ever made! After it cooled it wasn't as good and was a little dry, but whole wheat flour will do that. Next time I'll add a little more soy milk."
"0","4","Quick and easy! I replaced 2 tablespoons of flour with almond flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Also, increased the milk to 3/4 cup instead of 1/2. I would definitely make this again!"
"0","4","This is what I would call a 'yellow' rather than a 'white' cake, but very good."
"0","5","Excellent! I love that it's so few ingredients and so simple! I took another posters advice and added a dollop of strawberry jam and tucked it into the middle. Made for a nice treat sans frosting"
"0","2","Cake wasn't moist. Barely had any flavor. Won't use this recipe again."
"0","5","Just made this recipe as a Valentine's surprise for my mother and she loved it! The cake had a nice fluffy texture and wasn't too sweet. However I noticed the batter was a bit thick, so I added 1/4 cup more of milk, but it was no hassle. All in all, a lovely recipe!"
"0","4","This is a four and a half. I added 1/4 cup more milk. I used meringue buttercream frosting from this site ( I added cocoa powder to it for a delicious chocolate frosting) and they are very good. My niece wants them for her birthday party."
"0","3","Dry but otherwise good."
"0","5","Amazing with fruit topping (I used sliced strawberries and blueberries) and whipped cream!"
"0","5","This cake is amazing! I made this no problemo. I made cupcakes with the recipe and sent it with my dad for him to bring to work, and they wanted more. I suggest putting a little bit more vanilla in though. This is a very good recipe & I would strongly recommend it."
"0","5","Perfect!"
"0","5","Like a few other I used half butter half vegetable shortening, doubled the vanilla extract and mixed it on medium speed with my Kitcheaid for 5 minutes. The result was a super light moist cake. In fact it was so airy that you could see the air pockets when you slice it. I will never buy store bought cake again."
"0","4","Tried it and was extremely satisfied... Didnt even have time to take a picture. I made some cupcakes and frosted them with something I just sort of thougth up myself. Made a cheesecake frosting! Yei! Love the recipe hon.. Keep it comin'!"
"0","4","This cake was really simple to make and turned out really moist and delicious. I replaced 1 tbsp flour with 1 tbsp cornstarch,added 1/2 tsp salt (like some reviews suggested)and used only 3/4 cup sugar which was just right."
"0","4","This recipe is extremely simple and delicious! I like how it turns out the consistency that cake batter should be. I also 'sour' my milk (add a little vinegar to the milk, or use buttermilk) and it makes them extra delicious!"
"0","5","I just made this with my grandmother. It's very delicious! We doubled the recipe and it came out just perfect! I will definitely be using this recipe all the time for holidays."
"0","5","This is the best vanilla/white cake I ever had! I just made cupcakes with it and they are so moist and have a fantastic flavor. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and an extra 1/4 cup of milk, other than that I followed the recipe. Thanks a bunch for this!"
"0","5","great tasting cake with an easy recipe. thank you very much."
"0","5","I've used this recipe as is and added spices to make a spice cake. It turns out perfectly every time!"
"0","5","Used this recipe to make rainbow cupcakes for my daughters birthday, and also red and yellow cupcakes to celebrate Spain's football world cup win. simple recipe, sweet cupcake, easy to color."
"0","5","I made some changes I add veg oil not butter. And I add 1/2 teaspoon salt. My husband thought I made them from a box. I have now add it to my kids cook books I am making them for when they leave my house."
"0","4","I give this recipe a go. I wanted something sweet this evening but didn't want an entire cake on had as I am cutting back. I also wanted something that was simple and quick. I googled and found this recipe. I halved the recipe and put the batter into 2 mini quiche dishes. The outcome was great! I agree with the others. If you expecting a cake that is really light and fluffy, alter the recipe a bit or keep looking. But if you just need something to hit the spot and your tastes buds are forgiving, this is a winner."
"0","5","Well I'm 16 and I am taking culinary arts II and we had to cook a desert for 125 people (we only had to cook a portion) so we needed to make 24 cupcakes so we doubled the recipe and even though we didn't get to try them they were still moist after a day and when you iced them they didn't fall apart they hold there shape quite well, we were also asked several times for the recipe, so I guess that means they were pretty good."
"0","5","I actually thought this was the easiest recipie for a vanilla cake. I substituted the milk for pineapple juice, and made an upsidedown pineapple cake! yummm yum!"
"0","4","Very tasty. Made with coconut sugar."
"0","5","OMG this recipe is the BEST! I have used a few different recipes for cupcakes and hands down this recipe is perfect. Reading a few of the reviews was key to the successful outcome. I creamed the butter and sugar until fluffy (approximately 10-15 minutes). I also increased the milk to (1) cup of milk and the consistency was PERFECT! I used a buttercream frosting and my husband asked when was I going to make them again! I can't wait to use this recipe again. So good...So good....So good!"
"0","5","I LOVE IT. TASTE LIKE MY FAVORITE BUTTER COOKIES IN CAKE FORM."
"0","2","I used magarine and stevia (which are usually fine substitutes), but I had to add more milk, almost twice as much, and this cake had NO lift! I should have tested it before making it for my birthday, it's a good thing I'm soaking it in espresso, layering it with cream cheese and covering it in chocolate!"
"0","5","AMAZING!!! Easy and tastes great!"
"0","3","Tasted ok but very dense even though I added a little more milk. More of a pound cake consistency."
"0","4","Very simple directions, and a good basic recipe. The only reasons this will not get five stars from me is the fact that I made an operator error using my brand new cake-pop maker. Every pop came out underdone, but this was not the fault of the recipe. I also had to add some additional milk to the batter to get the correct consistency, a half cup did not make my batter 'smooth'. The few pops that came out correctly were delicious, however, and I will be using this recipe again."
"0","4","The recipe actually has enough batter to yield 18 cupcakes instead of 12. Otherwise it is a pretty nice recipe, but the quantity is underestimated."
"0","4","Really easy :)"
"0","5","tried this recipe last night and everyone loved it, making it again tonight. Topped it with leftover cream cheese frosting."
"0","3","Tasted like sugar cookies. Nice. Not great."
"0","5","just made a batch of these and the cakes are deeelish! I had halved the recipe, and added sweet choc chip morsels. I baked them for 20 minutes in a mini- cupcake foil tray. They didn't brown on the top, but when I stuck in a knife, it came out clean.  They taste amazing,just the right bite size. They remind me of this store in NY a block away from Grand Central, called 'Baked by Melissa'. yum! And so simple to make!"
"0","5","so good! substituted buttermilk - this is a keeper recipe!"
"0","5","Fabulous recipe, delicious cake and so easy to make. - Christine"

"0","5","LOVED THIS RECIPE! It is moist and fluffy. Its good if you serve it with berries and whipped cream. I will make this again!"
"0","5","Really good! I made cupcakes and added a little more milk based on others suggestions and they were moist and delicious!"
"0","3","Wasnt the best flavor ive had for white cake"
"0","5","This cake is really good! love the recipe."
"0","5","Made this cake as a 9' layer cake with fresh strawberry filling and a cool whip frosting. It turned out great."
"0","4","I loved how simple the recipe was! I didn't have vanilla so i replaced it with cinnamon and holiday spices for a great seasonal cupcake it taste amazing! I'm going to make it for my friends annual thanksgiving party , i hope they will love them just like i did."
"0","4","I used this to make my rainbow cake. I made the batter, then divided it up into six bowls to dye each bowl it's proper color. The cake tasted fantastic, I will use this recipe again when I need white cake."
"0","5","I really liked thi cake, it was fluffy and with a creamy frosting it tastes great!!"
"0","5","easiest cake recipe ever, and good tasting!!"
"0","5","This was wonderful - my new go-to cake recipe! The recipe doesn't list vanilla, but it is called for in the instructions, so be sure to add some. It was quick to whip up and tastes unlike anything that comes from a box. I followed the recipe exactly (doubled, plus the vanilla mentioned in the instructions) and had enough for two 9inch rounds plus a half-dozen delicious cupcakes."
"0","5","perfect! definitely using this recipe again!"
"0","4","These made some delicious cupcakes and were very easy to make. Like most reviewers suggested, I made sure to beat it thoroughly after every addition and upped the milk to 3/4 cup. I also sifted the flour and baking powder together before adding them (per the video instructions). The batter was wonderful but cooked it wasn't quite good enough for five stars. I upped the vanilla to a full tablespoon (to fulfill someone's birthday request for vanilla cake) and paired them with cinnamon frosting from another site."
"0","5","Awesome! I use this all the time. A splash of vanilla, and a pinch of salt and it comes out perfect and moist every time."
"0","5","This cake is SO GOOD! My family loves it and it was crazy easy to make. Thanks for sharing!  Also, I think it would be very simple to add different flavors without messing up the texture of the cake. I am excited to experiment with this recipe."
"0","5","Delish! loved it! Hubby isnt big on cake but he gobbled this down!"
"0","5","This was so easy to make and the results were fantasttic! Soft, moist, deee-lishus! We ran out of milk so substituted 1/2 cups milk with half & half and water. Oh yeah - we slso used cake flour instead...."
"0","5","Amazing! I make this with my three year old son all the time! Make sure you CREAM the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy. Wonderful!"
"0","3","I made the cake exactly as written, it was a little dry, next time I make it I will increase the milk, as others have. I am also not a fan of baking powder; to my taste it always has a bitter flavor. I will search for a baking powder substitute. Other than those 2 things the cake was as stated, SIMPLE!"
"0","3","I chose this recipe due to its simplicity in ingredients, but was a little disappointed. Cake was not as fluffy as I would like it to be and didn't have much flavor. My brother said it was more like eating bread than cake."
"0","3","This recipe was very bland and floury. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it was really tasteless. The second time I made it I did 1 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 3/4 cup of milk and doubled the sugar. It turned out much better that way."
"0","5","Fantastic! Moist and tasty! Added my own rainbow colours to the batter so that it would not look so boring. Added choc chips to it too!  Doubled the recipe as well.  My husband loves it! :) give it a try!"
"0","2","I followed this recipe exactly and will not be making it again. It was dry and the flavor was very disappointing."
"0","5","i am voting for romney, and this recepie is awsome! and i also am voting obama, and i actuaialy think it sucks"
"0","5","Just made 12 cupcakes for the grandkids for Thanksgiving Dinner tomorrow. The adults will love these. This recipe is fabulous. Light,fluffy and not too sweet! Anyone who knocks this recipe,simply can't bake. These are the best! I didn't change a thing."
"0","4","It tasted really good! Very simple and not at all hard to make. But you have to be careful when it's in the oven. Even a slight bit overcooked and it's ruined."
"0","1","I did not care for this recipe. Not at all what I had expected."
"0","5","The only change I made was I sifted my flour. They came out really fluffy and delicious with this frosting: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Vanilla---Chocolate-Powdered-Sugar-Frosting/Detail.aspx"
"0","4","Good recipe  I made cupcakes using this recipe for the first time and they turned out well. I used cake flour so I added an extra 3 tablespoons of flour. When baking with cake flour in a recipe that calls for all purpose flour add 2 extra tablespoons per cup.   I followed other reviewer's advice by:  1. Beating the cream and sugar to the extreme. You cannot take short cuts here. I then beat the eggs in until every thing was smooth.   I used the suggested half cup of milk and it turned out fine; however, I can see why some people may have to use 3/4 cup. I suggest that you watch your batter closely and adjust the milk as needed."
"0","5","Thank you for adding this simple recipe. As you know many people are out of work. This took minimal ingredients to make a big smile. The taste was just as big :)"
"0","5","this cake was very good tasting plus so moist no changes kids did not belive it was from scrach...........(:"
"0","5","Excellent. Works well got cakes and cupcakes. Great density for designer cakes."
"0","3","This was a decent cake, not good but decent. A little dry and yet dense all at the same time...made no changes to the original recipe but perhaps I should have. Thanks anyway."
"0","5","This cake turned out delicious for me. The sponge was moist and fluffy and had a lovely flavor. I decorated with a creamy fudge icing. Perfect combo!"
"0","4","Very nice. Double batch made 2 dozen regular sized cupcakes and 2 dozen minis. (Plus a lot of bowl licking!)"
"0","5","I made this recipe according to the directions for a double batch; however, I added 4 teaspoons Princess Cake emulsion from LorAnn's flavorings, and 2 teaspoons LorAnn 2-Fold Velvet Cream & 2 teaspoons LorAnn Butter Vanilla bakery emulsion. I mixed all the ingredients together very thoroughly. The taste is beyond describable!! Excellent choice to tweak with personal flavors!!!"
"0","5","i kind of customized this a little to fit what i made. i only used egg whites, and i ommitted the vanilla, but added 3 packets of instant apple cider mix, baked and topped with a brownsugar cinnamon frosting. AMAZING"
"0","3","I wish I had read reviews before I chose to make this recipe. I made cupcakes for my picky husband, and he ate 1 of the 18 I made from this recipe. The overall taste was quite good, but the texture was very dry, like cornbread. I will probably make this recipe again, but I will add more liquid - enough to make the batter pourable - and see how that fares. The flavor is interesting - almost like shortbread."
"0","5","Is recipe is amazing. Made this today along with my 4 yr old son and he said its very delicious atleast 20 times while eating his cupcake . That itself is 5 stars for me"
"0","5","A very moist,tasty cake. One of the best white cakes I've ever eaten. Thanks."
"0","2","I made this cake and my son asked me was it cornbread!!! This cake had an after taste. I was not impressed. But I will try it again!!!"
"0","5","This was a very good and moist cake. I made a couple additions. I used 1 cup of milk. Added 1tsp nutmeg and 1tsp cinnimon. On the top I added fresh peaches and 1 raspbery each cupcake on the top of each one. I covered the peaches and raspberry with 1/4c brown sugar a sprinkle of nutmeg before adding to large cupcakes. I baked for 40 min and they came out perfect. I will try to add pictures of before and after. Made 10 large cupcakes.  Thanks for the recipe."
"0","5","Simple, effective and great tasting!"
"0","4","I worked with what I had so this is what I did: I used whole wheat flour instead of regular, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (I ran out), and 3 eggs instead of 2 because it seemed like it needed some moisture. I didn't have any milk so I mixed some hot chocolate mix into a 1/2 cup of water and used that in place of the milk. I made cupcakes and it turned out great! Not too sweet but moist and delicious!"
"0","5","Super easy and very tasty..."
"0","5","really enjooyed this easy cake"
"0","5","I very much enjoyed this light, fluffy white cake. It was easy to put the ingredients together and the cooking time was spot on. I made this cake at my boyfriend's house and discovered only after beginning the process that he owns NO measuring spoons nor a mixer of any type ('Why can't you use the blender?' he asked me. LOL). So despite having to eyeball the vanilla and baking powder and mix the dough with my hands, it still came out great. That's saying a lot!"
"0","5","This is the first cake I have made from scratch it turned out perfect! I made three layers and they All turned out perfect. It is easy to work with And tastes great!"
"0","2","Dry. Not much flavor."
"0","2","I tried this several times thinking I messed it up, I tried to add extra milk like some reviewers suggested. This recipe is easy, but the cake is just too dense and dry for my taste. In the end after several batches I decided to just go with a boxed mix, cheaper, moister, and less time consuming and this recipe only yielded about 12 cupcakes for me."
"0","5","So simple and easy to make. The cake was delicious and a perfect vessel for any fruit topping."
"0","5","YUM! And I don't typically like cake. We ran out of vanilla extract so we made it with almond extract - how lucky - it was delicious and moist!"
"0","5","Simple and delicious! I have made this recipe twice now, each time it turned out great. I did make a slight change- I used 1 teaspoon almond extract and 1 teaspoon vanilla, instead of 2teaspoons of vanilla the recipe calls for. I cooked it in a large springform pan. Cant believe how good it is...I will be making this often!"
"0","3","Way too heavy, but tastes yummy. Looking for another white cake recipe."
"0","3","Tasted good, but I think I may have done something wrong. I baked for 40 mins at 350f and when I came to remove it from the oven it was moving in the middle, it hadn't set. So I left it in for longer on 260f - 30 minutes later I end up with a cake that was level and runny in the middle to a cake which had sunk and was crumbling all over the place."
"0","5","this came out gorgeous. i made it into a layer cake with fresh kiwis/saskatoons and lime whipped cream for a family function - nobody in my family really likes sweet anything, and this was gone in five minutes. light, fluffy, not overly sugar-y tasting."
"0","5","Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and made smaller cakes and they turned out fine. I also substituted half of the sugar with splenda. I would definitely recommend this for a basic white cake recipe."
"0","5","I made this on the weekend for my cousin's 4yr old's birthday party. I made cupcakes instead, halved the recipe and got 8 cupcakes out of it. They were amazing! I used a can of Betty Crocker vanilla frosting blended with spreadable cream cheese and got rave reviews for them."
"0","5","wow! this was the best! I used a bit less butter and put some granulated sugar on top...it turned out fantastic. I dont think I have ever made better cup cakes in my life! THANK YOU SO MUCH 5 star texture 5star taste 5 star appearance!"
"0","5","this one is really awesome. soft and yummy"
"0","4","I give this recipe 4 stars because it is simple as stated in the name and it sets up well, but I was un-impressed with the flavor. It has a mild sweetness but nothing else to speak of. I do plan on using this recipe for my daughters castle cake since it does set so well, but I will be using a cream cheese frosting."
"0","4","This cake was very good. This recipe really does taste like a sugar cookie. The only think that I noticed was the cake's density gave it a kind of weird texture. Other then that though this cake was delicious and a hit! It paired nicely with a homemade lemon frosting."
"0","5","I have made this cake dozens of times since I found it last year. I have made cupcakes and birthday cake, and followed the recipe exactly (with the additional milk as other reviewers have noted). Everytime I have made this cake, EVERY SINGLE PERSON that tasted it has commented how absolutely DELICIOUS it was! I will never make another cake! I love this recipe!"
"0","4","Really really good! These are really basic so, if you're looking for something that tastes like it took hours of hard work then, sorry this recipe isn't for you. But, if you're looking for something that tastes really good and basic then, ta-dah! The recipe is for You! I was looking for a simple easy cupcake recipe becayse my little sister wanted cupcakes and this recipe was perfect for me. I only have one complaint, If you don't use cupcake wrapper things then the cupcakes fall apart (even if you spray the cupcake pan) so, you basicly have to use cupcake wrappers or they kinda stick to the pan and easily fall apart. Overall pretty good recipe."
"0","5","I just made this and it is amazing and soo easy not to mention tastes better than from the box. I am using it for a coconut cream poke cake and I am so excited for the end result. It takes me back to my Mom's baking. This is a keeper!"
"0","5","made it for the first time..n it was superb!! Me n my husband we both luvd it.... Thanks for sharing it:)"
"0","3","Definitely simple to make but mine turned out a bit heavy... possibly needs more baking powder or using cake flour in place of all-purpose. I used some lemon glaze on mine, which goes nicely."
"0","4","This cake was easy and delicious! Tastes like a sugar cookie :)"
"0","1","I did not like this cake at all. It was too dry and was not white,"
"0","4","This was a perfect recipe for additions. I put candied ginger in the last bit of it and baked it in a small ovenproof dish. I did change it up a bit by using half milk and half heavy cream. It was perfect!"
"0","1","I followed this recipe exactly and it didnt turn out for me at all. The cake turns out like cornbread and it tastes like milk and flour with a hint of sugar."
"0","5","I have been looking for a white cake recipe that is light and fluffy and moist when you make it and not heavey or too dry. I have now found the recipe. Thank you for posting this one. It's amazing!"
"0","5","This cake was a hit at my daughter's party with both children and adults alike. I followed a lot of people's advice and beat, beat, beat. Definitely take care to follow instruction with this cake and it will not fail you. Smells heavenly while it's baking, tastes like sugar cookies without being too strong.   I used a white chocolate ganache and strawberry buttercream frosting. The cake combined well with the flavours. Can't wait to try other frosting/filling combinations."
"0","4","This recipe is pretty good. I used it to make cupcakes and it turned out great! Tastes awesome with vanilla or chocolate icing."
"0","4","Should say simple pound cake. Was perfect to make with my 4 yrvold son. No over beating since you beat each step a lot giving him a lot of mixer time and me time to help him with every step. We did as other reviewers suggested and added 1/4 c milk extra and upped vanilla to 1 T. We made cup cakes 12, then added homemade raspberry jelly 2-3 T to the remainder for 1 dozen mini cupcakes."
"0","5","This was an awesome cake. I made cupcakes out of it and didn't have to frost. Very good recipe."
"0","4","Very nice, light cupcakes. And not overly sweet. I made the following substitutions: buttermilk + almond milk instead of regular milk (upped milk by 1/4 cup as per other reviewer's recommendations). Swapped in 1/2 cup of brown sugar for refined sugar. Addition of pinch of salt, pinch of cinnamon and 1tbsp of vanilla instead of what is recommended. Butter and eggs were cold but I beat the hell out of it with the kitchenaid to get the 'cool whip' texture described by the other reviewers. Didn't need icing....they won't last long!! Yum yum. I am curious what variations could be performed...."
"0","5","I love this recipe. I am weight-conscious, so I use wheat-flour. It comes out crumby and delicious. I reduce sugar and butter levels, and it still tastes very good. I use 3 egg whites. Very forgiving recipe. Love it. My kids enjoy it with me. What a better alternative!"
"0","1","Even though this cake was easy to make, I found this cake to be very lacking in flavor. It tasted like I left something out and I re-read the ingredients several times. It did turn out to be very fluffy and moist. I did read other reviews and beat the mixture a lot. I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed. Wont be making this again."
"0","1","I followed the recipe step by step and probably wont use this recipe again!"
"0","5","just baked it , simple, lite, its perfect!!  simple and can mix anything you like with it ;) i put in half of the batter in the baking pan, mixed 2 table spoons of cocoa powder with the other half then pored it on top of the rest. turned out amazing :))"
"0","5","Very tasty! I loved how it was fabulous yet simple and fast to make! I made this for a party and everyone loved it!!!"
"0","5","Good cake just how it is :)"
"0","5","This recipe is awesome, I personalized it a bit and made it into a marble cake, and used a few review tips to make it better 5 outta 5, great recipe (:"
"0","5","I love this recipe! The cupcakes come out so delicious! I add 1/4 cup more milk and a full teaspoon of vanilla. Yum!"
"0","5","I thought the flavor was lovely. It was a nice small cake."
"0","5","This is one of the best cakes I have ever made!! I made it with my little 3 & 6 y/o granddaughters & it was easy to make & they had a ball. It has that homemade buttery flour taste.....yum. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to make it again.  Arvey Caterer"
"0","5","I just recently got into baking from scratch and this is a delightfully fast and tasty cake batter! I made it last night as cupcakes, and yes, I taste wonderful sugar cookie as the barely crunchy top (after icing, it will soften right up) and moist delicate cake inside. I can't wait to make it again as a 9x9 cake to have as the base for summertime strawberry shortcake. Thank you for a great recipe, with ingredients so readily on hand."
"0","5","Last nite i made this cake for my mom's birthday mmmmmmmmm. It was so good that when i got home my husband said to make him one and on his a glazed it with cremes (this a Haitian tres leche that has white rum in it)"
"0","5","excellent"
"0","2","Cake was super dry but if you serve it with ice cream it is good cause it will hold a lot of moisture"
"0","4","This cake was amazing! Light and fluffy, but not too sweet. After i took it out of the oven, instead of icing it, i sprinkled it with cinnimon, it turned out awesome! Super easy and fast too!!"
"0","3","Easy to make BUT tastes like an Easy Bake Oven cake mix! Not a great flavor. Consistency was nice. I smothered it in strawberry juice, strawberries and whipped cream... so it was edible."
"0","4","I made cupcakes for my child's bake sale from this recipe and they were a HIT! I added some maple (I am not 'by the teaspoon' person, so just eyeballing I'd say maybe 1 tablespoon, little more?) and the kids LOVED it. Adding maple gives it a great snap. I frosted them half vanilla and half chocolate. VERY moist and fluffy, I also don't get why others are saying dry or dense. :)"
"0","5","Just used this to make cake pops. Perfect recipe!"
"0","5","So easy and yummy. I added chocolate chips to it and made cupcakes for my babys 1st bday."
"0","5","simply the best white cake I've ever made. It has a nice sugary crust while the inside is dense yet soft and fluffy. Works well as both a cake AND cupcakes! I made sure to beat the sugar and butter for 10 minutes (set a timer!) and beat each of the eggs really well before adding the vanilla.  Also, instead of using regular milk, I added white vinegar to the milk and let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before adding it to the batter. So I used 2 tsp of vinegar per 3/4 cup of milk. Someone suggested 3/4 cups of milk and they were right! And absolute keeper, my dad was like 'how come you only gave me half a cupcake? I want a whole one!' haha! If an old asian dude says that, this recipe must be good! Thanks so much scottosman for the recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe is amazing. I use it all the time when I make cupcakes, and sometimes add things like m&ms and chocolate chips. It always comes out moist and delicious."
"0","4","Very easy!!!! Great taste!"
"0","3","Good and easy to make. I thought it tasted more like a muffin but I'd probably make it again."
"0","5","This cake is just always so good. Sometimes I add a teaspoon of almond extract and sometimes I make cupcakes. Easy go to recipe."
"0","5","This recipe was so easy to make and the cake tasted so good!"
"0","1","I made this simple white cake and it doesn't come out great. the cake taste like flour, not delicious and nice like white cake from the box. I tried make other batch with just 3 eggs white instead of 2 eggs and add little more milk. It came out just the same. same taste. The cake doesn't rise great. This recipe need to be adjust big time. I am sorry for negative review."
"0","5","This is a delightful cake!! I did however add 1/4 of a cup extra to the recipe someone else recommended it. Super moist! I put marshmallow fluff icing on it and it does taste like a sugar cookie!!"
"0","4","Takes like a sugar cookie. Very heavy and rich...but yummy too."
"0","5","This cake recipe is fabulous! I added a half a tablespoon of bourbon and will keep it in the recipe when I make it again (and again and again)."
"0","4","I really like this cake, it's simple, quick and easy! My only complaint is that it's a little dense."
"0","5","I've made this many times now as cupcakes and it is PHENOMENAL! I prefer a drier cupcake so I bake them in really big cupcake tins (makes 6 total) for 30 minutes and they come out perfectly. The only change I made was I substituted a 1/2 oz of Disaronno for the vanilla. I top them off with a frosting consisting of a stick of butter, 2 cups confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa power, and 1/2 oz of Chambord, with half and half as needed. My mother, who goes to the fancy cupcake bakeries in NYC, absolutely raves about these cupcakes, claiming they're the best she's ever had."
"0","5","Simple and delicious."
"0","4","This cake is wonderful with icing. but i had to put it in the fridge and then i had to ice it the next day."
"0","5","Incredibly easy to make and so good! I've even done this recipe in a loaf pan (strange but true) and it worked beautifully -- mind that I had to add a a few more minutes to compensate for the pan.  A definite favorite at my house. Thank you so much!"
"0","1","I would not recommend this cake to anyone! It came out burnt on the outsides and not even cooked on the insides."
"0","5","Perfect density for cake pops! My 4yr old and 2yr were happy that their mommy (who can't bake) made a yummy cake mix!"
"0","2","The recipe calls for too much baking powder. I made these as cupcakes and didn't care for them. Any number of simple yellow or white cake recipes are preferable, for example Better Homes & Gardens 'Best Two Egg Cake'."
"0","4","it was really good. The 'problem' with it isn't really a problem. Almost everyone i know is REALLY used to the blandness of box cake, so when I made it, we all thought that it was so sweet it tasted like corn-bread."
"0","4","You have to add more milk than called for otherwise you get a cake brick but overall it's a wonderful recipe!"
"0","5","It's simple and delicious"
"0","5","Was a bit nervous making this for the first time for a dinner party. But I'm glad I did. Everybody loved it, and it had the perfect rich vanilla taste."
"0","5","Came out perfect. Thanks!"
"0","5","I love it. Is easy to bake and not messy. I've changed the ingredients to be natural and organic by using Brown Sugar, Organic Flour, Fresh squeezed orange juice and peels to replace vanilla extract. Taste good."
"0","3","it tasted like sugar cookies but did not rise"
"0","5","This was a really good cake. I made this for a club and it turned out FANTASTIC! Thank you so much for the great recipe. The finished cake turned out perfect!"
"0","5","I CAN'T STOP EATING IT!  Not only is this recipe ridiculously easy and simple to follow, but it tastes outrageous! I love it. Nice and firm for stacking also."
"0","5","This frosting turned out PERFECT for my chocolate cupcakes. I added a tablespoon of peanut butter and and cinnamon...almost didn't have any frosting left for the cupcakes because my family ate it all before they were done! Delicious!"
"0","5","So soft and really good flavor. Super quick and easy."
"0","5","This was an awesomely moist cake!! I used it as the cake for a pineapple upside down cake and it was great. The only alteration I made to the cake recipe itself was I used almond milk in place of the regular and it really tasted good! Everyone loved it!"
"0","4","itz easy n awesome... loved it"
"0","5","Great easy cake!"
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely awesome.... I made it once when I needed something in a hurry, and now I'll never use anything else!"
"0","5","Oh My Gosh ! This was so good ! My family loves it. Thanks so much."
"0","2","I tried this twice, both on special occasions and both times I thought it would turn out better than it did. The cake is very dense, which I suppose is good for some, but I like mine light and fluffy. So I guess I'll just keep looking. This is not the white cake for me!"
"0","4","I made this recipe twice, It's one of the easiest cakes that I have come across."
"0","5","Easy, Fabulous...frosted with strawberry cream cheese frosting! Yummy.."
"0","5","Great simple and basic cake.   If I am not adding frosting/icing i will add a little extra vanilla extract. If I make a frosting I add a little coconut flake. Also I sometimes add a little almond extract. Great starter cake to add and play around with flavors.  Just make sure that when you cream the butter is at room temperature."
"0","4","I was looking for a quick-easy-good recipe, and I found it!! Although I had to substitute milk for buttermilk and the cake turned out perfect!"
"0","5","I have not baked yet I added extra milk and milk chocolate pudding."

"0","4","A very nice simple recipe with few ingredients that tasted good. A good way to get started if you are learning to cook homemade recipes and not boxed."
"0","5","This is a GREAT recipe!!!! I divide the batter in to six different bowls and put food coloring in them to make rainbow cupcakes!!! They are SUPER fun and YUMMY!!! Thanks you so much!!!"
"0","5","This was delicious. It was very eady to make and turned out moist on the inside, while there was a crisp crust on the outside that made it easy to frost. I doubled it and it nicely filled out two round cake pans."
"0","4","It was sorta dry. Tastes good with buttercream frosting"
"0","5","Love this recipe, used it for my sons' first birthday cake"
"0","5","Excellent cake! I used it for cupcakes and it was easy and quick. Topped it with grapefruit icing and got great reviews. This is definitely a keeper(:"
"0","5","I made this for my husband's birthday. Everyone loved it! The only difference was that I added 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2. The cake came out more moist. This goes great with strawberries/fruit inside 2 layers!"
"0","5","I have only ever used boxed cakes and thought I was cake incompetent until this recipe. It turns out beautifully! I do recommend using the increased milk as discussed in the reviews below and making sure the eggs are very well combined 'creamy yellow cool whip' is the perfect descriptor for what this step should look like. I liked it paired with the whipped cream cream cheese frosting also on here :)"
"0","4","This recipe worked great! I would without a doubt make it again. I made cupcakes in stead of cake, and they turned out amazing. If you're making cupcakes in stead of cake, i would add a pinch of baking soda, becuase the cupcakes caved in. one of my tips for this recipe is to add about a 1/2 tspn of almond extract and a little more vanilla."
"0","2","Way to dense! Not such a good flavor either."
"0","5","This is a wonderful cake recipe, I add a little more vanilla, but it works wonders for fondant."

"0","5","I LOVE this cake. I have made it twice now and all my friends love it and have asked me to make it again. I bake it in a bunt pan and use a lemon glaze. YUMM! :o)"
"0","5","really good! I just made them for the first time as cupcakes, and added an extra half cup of milk. besides that I followed directions exactly and they are delicious"
"0","5","This was a great recipe! I was making rainbow cupcakes and the cake was so moist and flavourful!"
"0","5","My first time making white cake from scratch and it was very easy. I loved it, especially with buttercream frosting! Yum. Very dense, as other reviewers have said, like wedding cake."
"0","3","I enjoyed the taste but felt it was a drier cake. Although, not sure if my opinion counts I don't bake very often."
"0","3","Dry, made less batter than I anticipated."
"0","5","The cake was fluffy, moist and delicious I added 1/4 of extra milk as adviced by fellow members. Thank you for posting it!! Reminds me of my childhood."
"0","4","Tastes great but the other reviewers are correct about it having a texture much like cornbread. The batter was really dense, but it made 12 perfect cupcakes!"
"0","4","This cake was pretty good, but very dense! I had to use the only cake pan I own, which is a 9x13 inch pan. This will make a thin cake in a 9x13 inch pan so definitely increase the recipe size! Overall the flavor is really buttery much like a pound cake!"
"0","2","This is an easy recipe and my daughter enjoyed making it, but it wasn't very moist. We tried it two different times and got the same results."
"0","1","i made this last night and it was very bland. it didn't rise and you could of sworn it was cornbread."
"0","1","I made cupcakes with this recipe. It was very boring and not much taste to it."
"0","2","Very thin and bland."
"0","3","dry, but I think I overbaked the cupcakes. I'll make them again and update my rating if it's different!"
"0","5","YUMMY! followed the advice of the #1 reviewer. However, the batter seemed to thick to 'fold in' egg whites so I put it all in the bowl and used the kitchenaid on the lowest setting just long enough for them to be combined. Still turned out AWESOME!! paired it with butter creme frosting. mmmmmmmmmmm"
"0","3","I've made this twice now...the first time it came out very plain. I know its a simple white cake recipie but the cake itself had no taste. I made it exact to the recipie. I also found the cake crumbled very easily The second time I made it I added more vanillia and a touch more sugar and butter. It tasted a lot better."
"0","5","I made these into cupcakes and they were the best cupcakes I've ever had. I agree with all who have said that the taste resembles that of a sugar cookie. Thanks so much for the recipe, scottosman- this is my go-to cupcake recipe from here on out."
"0","3","The flavor of this cake is excellent, but mine did turn out very dense (but very moist) even though I beat the daylights out of the batter after each addition. I increased the vanilla to 1 Tbsp and added sprinkles for a 'funfetti' cake. My batter was VERY fluffy...kind of like a cool whip consistency. I am going to give this another try with more milk as suggested."
"0","5","I made this cake in cupcake form as a 'test run' for my daughter's birthday later this month. Since I was interested in having a good tasting cake, we taste-tested without frosting. YUMMY! I'm very impressed! The cupcakes came out fairly moist and fluffy. My husband inhaled two of them, and I have to admit that I'm guilty of the same! Our toddler loves them. As other reviewers have commented, this is a very sweet recipe. I might try reducing the sugar next time I make it - or just eat them without frosting!"
"0","4","I baked this simple cake and added my own touch because it looked too simple....so...sliced it in two, spread pineapple jam... and guess what? ....delicious!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","3","It was okay, but that's about it. I will keep looking for a really good homemade white cake recipe."
"0","4","Made this tonight into mini cupcakes.. came out great but did have a bit of a flour taste to them.. next time I think I'll add a bit more sugar and vanilla. Really a great base recipe though!!"
"0","4","I'm a college student majoring in nutrition and we had to take a recipe and have three alterations for a disease. I replaced eggs (egg allergy) for bananas, flaxseed and water, and Ener-G Egg Replacement. Everyone loved them! They all tested amazing, but the bananas (6 tablespoons mashed instead of eggs) were a huge hit. The only issue was that the cakes sunk in in the middle, this could be due to my higher elevation, though. But I'd definitely recommend this recipe!"
"0","5","These cupcakes were so good and so simple to make. We decorated them with fall colored frosting and candy corns. Yummy! Excellent cake recipe!"
"0","2","I don't if I did something not quite right or not, but these came out sort of dry and dense. I used half and half instead of milk bc I had no milk in the house, so maybe that's why? Either way, these didn't come out as I was hoping =[ I will try again, next time using milk."
"0","2","Not really that great... kinda tough and boring. Won't make these again."
"0","4","I made this cake for my mother-in-law for her birthday. I doubled the recipe in order to make a two layered cake, put chocolate pudding in the middle, and frosted it with chocolate frosting. Someone already reviewed that it tastes like a cookie, and I did get that flavoring with mine as well. I followed the recipe exactly taking careful attention to my preparation and it was a good cake. The only complaint I have is that it is a really dense cake, and I would have liked something a little lighter."
"0","5","Yummy!"
"0","5","WOW! I made this for the first time today. I think it took 5 minutes to mix it all up. It was super easy. And let me tell you it is SUPER good. I only made 12 cupcakes as a test and they are GONE! I will be using this all the time. No more boxes for me. Thank you!"
"0","1","i made the cake just like it said because i was trying it for a bake sale. but to me the cake wasnt that great and came out really plan and had no flavor"
"0","5","very good...."
"0","4","I followed the recipe last night. Like stated above I added more milk. I also added some butter extract for more flavoring. I added coco to the mix for chocolate cupcakes as well. People @ work loved the cupcakes."
"0","5","I've made this 2 times so far. Once as written. The second time I doubled the recipe for a layer cake and substituted lemon extract for the vanilla. Delicious and easy!"
"0","5","This was super easy and I got reve reviews from some picky eaters. I made the cake in a small glass loaf pan. I added more milk like other reviewers said to do but it messed up the consistancy so I had to add more flour to even it out. It didn't effect the final outcome so I'll just increase the amount of milk and flour a tiny bit to the entire recipe. This would make great cupcakes!"
"0","4","Good flavor, easy to prepare."
"0","3","The taste was fine, and I like that this cake is dense. However, it turned out very dry- almost like cornbread."
"0","3","i'm not so sure if i liked this cake. i used half of the batter as chocolate and half white, but it didnt turn out as i expected. the texture was a bit dry and bland- i was looking for something more. but i didn't over bake it either! adding a few sugar crystals and chocolate chips before baking on the top of the cupcakes is great (if not wanting icing)"
"0","4","i really felt like it needed an extra 1/4 c of milk. they were very yummy!"
"0","5","I made this recipe because I was in need of an asap recipe to make a cupcake cake. They flavor is just great. I always add a tiny bit more vanilla, but never the less, great cake recipe. I would suggest this to anyone."
"0","5","Worked very well with this lemon icing Lemon icing 1 cup icing 2 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon lemon juice"
"0","5","I didn't have baking powder so I substituted 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cornstarch, and about 3 tbsp key lime juice. It came out superbly. The key lime adds a really nice touch. The cake is also not terribly sweet, which I like."
"0","5","Thank you for this recipe... It has become my base recipe for any new cake that I'm trying out... My most recent one has been an apple cake where I used 1 cup pureed apple instead of the 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk called for in the recipe. And yes, oil instead of butter. It was so springy and delicious!"
"0","5","Great base white cake! I used 3/4 c milk. To make a layer cake, just double the recipe for 2 9x9 pans. I have baked pineapple cupcakes using this recipe and they turned out awesome! For the pineapple cupcakes, I used 1/2 C. Milk & 1/2 C. Pineapple juice. Use 1 Tsp vanilla & 1 Tsp coconut extract. Stir in 3-4 Tbsp crushed pineapple into the batter and bake for 25 min. For the icing I used the Buttercream Icing by Sharon from this site. I added a tad bit of pineapple juice to the frosting and garnished with pineapple! Yummy!"
"0","5","This recipe is so quick and easy! I made this twice once for my friend's mom's birthday then another day for myself. It was fantastic! I made little changes to the recipe. For my cake I cut the sugar in half because I was afraid it might be too sweet. I also cut the vanilla in half for both cakes and used whole milk. This is a great recipe for a birthday cake or any occasion!"
"0","4","I made this recipe today, doubling it to make 24 cupcakes and an 8' single layer cake. The only change I made was to add just a dash more milk...I'm not even sure it was needed. The taste of this is excellent. However, with the cupcake I sampled, it stuck to the paper a little and kind of fell apart. This could definitely be 'user-error' since I seldom ever bake cupcakes! I tried to remove the cake from the pan, but it wouldn't budge, eventhough I greased & floured the pan. Even with those two 'mis-steps', no matter! We can eat the cupcakes w/forks, and I'm sure I can manage to get the cake out somehow! Excellent flavor! Thanks so much for the recipe. I will be trying to improve my technique."
"0","5","I had one of my student bakers make these into cupcakes. He got rave reviews! This is my go to recipe for white cupcakes."
"0","3","I made this for the first time yesterday and added more milk and vanilla as suggested. The cake tastes great, but for me, it came out a little dry. I baked it the full 40 minutes in a 9x9 metal pan. I'm willing to experiment and try making this again because it's a great tasting cake."
"0","4","This is a great recipe when you need to whip up a simple cake and don't have much time. It is moist and delicious and i have used it to make everything from cupcakes to a three layer strawberry cake."
"0","5","Loved it! I made this twice now for two birthdays of my kids ."
"0","5","I just love this cake.."
"0","4","Taste better with a little less vanilla extract."
"0","5","Really good recipe. I used vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk and it came out lovely. Really good flavor and easy to make. I used recipe to make mini cupcakes for a bday party. 15 minutes in oven at 350 degrees."
"0","4","I used raw sugar and King Arthur Bread Flour because that is what I had on hand and due to the previous reviews saying the cake was dry decided to add a splash more milk and couple of dollops of sour cream. I also colored the batter green (as they were for a 2 year old's birthday) and over-filled the cupcake cups and ended up with disks on top. Despite the hideous appearance, the cake itself was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Next I am going to use cake flour, no food coloring, not overfill the cups, and pipe on a rich chocolate frosting. I may use less sugar to allow the frosting to shine. Excellent; looking forward to tweaking this one."
"0","5","The most delicious cake ever. It's really dense and not very sweet, so I recommend a frosting with it to sweeten it up, though I've added melted chocolate, fruit, powdered sugar, etc. as a frosting. My birthday cake for all my friends. To make a slightly chocolaty cake, add hot chocolate mix, like ovaltine. Yummy."
"0","1","This cake was so super dense it was more like a pound cake that a fluffy white cake."
"0","4","these are good, pretty dense but on the bland side. Good for filling because they'll hold up well and taste a whole lot better. I'll add more vanilla next time. These saved me when I had no cake mix on hand. really easy to make."
"0","4","I thought the cakes were overall pretty bland. I cut a hole in the top of the cupcakes and filled it with raspberry jam. The frosting was the recipe for cream cheese frosting, which was very good. I topped the cupcakes off with fresh raspberries and blueberries. Overall, the cupcake was very delicious."
"0","4","Delicious! I added a little extra milk to make it a bit smoother and the result was fantastic. I used this recipe to make cupcakes, they baked up a little higher than I had hoped. Maybe the next batch i'll only fill the cupcake liners 1/2 full!"
"0","1","This cake is more like a cake to make strawberry shortcake. It is very compact and dry. Not a white fluffy cake for a birthday cake. I followed the directions exactly as they were written. Dissapointed it was not a fluffy cake, but happy that I found the base to a strawberry shortcake!"
"0","5","OMG! this is the best cake i have ever made!! everyone loves it! thanks!"
"0","5","Made great cupcakes to create the Princess Belle tiara cupcake cake that I made for a friend's daughter. Everyone loved that they were not 'too' sweet, just right! I uploaded the picture of the cake."
"0","4","I followed this recipe and had two beautiful 6 inch rounds to use as a second tier of a cake. And maybe this is a novice mistake, but I put the cake in the fridge (b/c I used cream cheese icing and felt funny leaving it out), and upon taking it out and cutting, the cake was very dry. Fast forward 12 hours and the cake has been sitting out and is now the perfect moist cake I was looking for. I will use this recipe again and stick to buttercream next time."
"0","3","This would have been a great recipe but the cake batter turned out to be a bit runny. I altered the recipe using 1/4 cup of butter 1/4 cup of shortening and 3/4 cup of milk and a pinch of salt. The overall outcome when it was fresh was great and the top was a bit crispy but after it sat there for a while the cake became dry. Next time I will try it with less amount of sugar and all shortening to keep it moist"
"0","3","Overall, this cake was good, but the texture was very off-putting. It is rather grainy like cornbread, or some of the Dominican cakes I've tasted before. I did not add the extra milk, so perhaps that would have made it moister and more enjoyable. I think it would make a good 'finger cake' to take on picnics and such, but not as good as pound cake."
"0","4","Super simple recipe, but very delicious. It's not too sweet which goes great when you ice the cake or cupcakes. I made this batter, split it into 4 bowls, dyed each bowl a neon color and then made rainbow cupcakes. They baked at 350 for about 20 minutes and turned out wonderful!"
"0","5","We loved this recipe for it was easy and YUMMY! We added some strawberries and it tasted even better. We made a batch without them, it was good but to floury. Is that a word?"
"0","5","The cake was so good, the kids loved them. It was very simple and easy to make."
"0","5","This is the best tasting homemade cake I have ever made! It comes out light and fluffy. I used this recipe for the Cupcake + Brownie batter = the second best cupcake ever recipe from this site. These were cupcake perfection!"
"0","5","This is an absolutely terrific recipe! It truly lives up to its name, it's simple, and might I add every bit delicious. I have made this on several occasions sometimes as a cake other times as cupcakes and it has always been a crowd favorite. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe."
"0","5","Great recipe! I added a little extra milk and vanilla per other reviews and the taste was delicious! Definitely a bit more dense than a boxed white cake mix, but it works perfect for cupcakes. I used a very thick chocolate frosting with this recipe and got rave reviews."
"0","5","I just made these cupcakes and they were delicious. I thought they were moist and fluffy. I followed the recipe exactly except added a little almond extract too. I was worried because, I didn't add extra milk as other reviewers but it didn't matter because they were great as is. No need for boxed cake mix anymore!!"
"0","5","great and simple basic yellow cake recipe. tasty and easy, five stars. followed to a 'T' except added a little extra milk like most others did."
"0","4","It's not perfect--comes out a bit dry for me when baked to the toothpick test, and still gooey if I take it out beforehand--but it's the simplest and best recipe for cake I've yet found."
"0","5","Make sure to have fresh baking powder. Comes out perfect every time!"
"0","5","I made this cake last night for my boyfriends birthday, and let me just tell you, it was absolutley AMAZING. I made no changes."
"0","5","These were great! I made them exactly according to the recipe for a birthday and everyone loved them! They were quite suddenly gone."
"0","5","Came out just as I wanted it too! For those reviewers who said it has the texture of cornbread, it does have that but it's not a bad thing. I loved the texture of this cake."
"0","5","This recipe is fluffy and delicious. Simple for a midnight snack or elegant for a wedding this cake goes all the way! Just like everyone else I, too added a touch of milk and it is moist out of this world. Kick the box out, this recipe is ready for action!"
"0","4","It was easy to make, but it was extremely dry. I made a baby shower cake with this recipe. Taste great with buttercream frosting and buttercream fondant. But many of the guests said it was too dry, a bit heavy, and had the consistency of cornbread!! But my parents thought it was one of my better cake recipe out of scratch, it was flavorful. i think i'll give this cake another try.. but next time i'll follow some of the reviews and will mix longer and add more milk and see how it turns out. crossing fingers!"
"0","5","This is a completely easy and yummy recipe. One of my favourites."
"0","1","I followed the recipe and reviews, adding a little more milk. I should have saved the milk for washing down this extremely dense cake. I'll agree it's moist, but so dense it is far from appetizing. I am very disappointed."
"0","3","This cake was pretty good, but a tad too dry. It was really crusty and crumbly, not moist and soft. It works really well with a buttercream icing."
"0","4","Pretty good but I did add extra milk like alot of other reviews stated they did."
"0","5","I made a gluten-free version, substituting Bob Mill's all purpose FG flour 1:1 and adding 1/2 tsp Xanthan gum. I also added a little more milk. The cake turned out fantastic! Couldn't even tell it was gluten-free"
"0","5","so far so good! i have these cupcakes in the oven as we speak. i will come back as soon as they are out of the oven to update! :) i did beat the heck out of the batter after each addition of an egg as suggested by other reviewers and i upped the milk by 1/4 cup (to 3/4 of a cup) as suggested. fingers crossed! i've been looking for a great white cake recipe so i hope it's THE one! :) update: DELICIOUS! worthy of 5 stars! it has a great velvety texture and is sweet without being too sweet. this is a keeper! i also made the devil's food I recipe for cupcakes and i like this a lot more... i'm wondering if i can tweak it to make other flavors as well."
"0","3","It's good for a quick and simple cake, but it does seem to be missing something."
"0","4","I went ahead and used 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2, and I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to my cake batter as well. It was yummy! I will be posting photos to this page too!"
"0","5","this is awesome! i made it for fathers day and it worked perfectly so good!"
"0","4","Great and simple. I have added different ingredients to add a twist, dried cranberries and walnuts, shredded coconut, and or add chocolate to the milk. Love it!"
"0","5","This was fantastic. I added the extra milk as well. Next time I think I'll reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup. I made this cake for fresh sliced strawberries, whip cream, chocolate pudding and shaved white and dark chocolate. It was fabulous!"
"0","1","This is pretty much the worst cake recipe I've ever used. Too heavy and dense, tasted almost exactly like cornbread. It's good if you're trying to make cornbread without the corn but terrible for a birthday cake. :)"
"0","5","I made this cake tonight for my stepson's birthday. I added one more egg and a little extra milk and it turned out fantastic. I also made this cake, but added cocoa for a chocolate cake and it turned out fantastic!! My family loved this cake. Very easy and I had all the ingredients around the house."
"0","3","This was OK, but honestly, not good enough to stop using a cake mix."
"0","2","The taste was yummy-- the batter was light and not overly sweet. Very promising at first. However, I followed the recipe to the letter and the cupcakes came out sticking to the papers to the point of crumbling into a hundred pieces when I started to pull the cake away from the paper. Tasted awesome, but in no way presentable for this Going Away party for which they were baked. :-("
"0","5","Really easy to make, added a little bit more milk. Used hershey's perfect chocolate frosting, so delicious!"
"0","5","I absolutely loved this cake and so did everyone who tried it. It's got the perfect wedding cake like consistency. It was just sweet enough that added with a fruit feeling gave the best taste."
"0","5","This was super easy and delish. We put it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. I used a cupcake pan, as I didn't have a 9X9 and it worked beautifully!"
"0","5","awesome recipe-made it today with my little man. love it!!! sooo yummmy, moist and fresh! thanks for the extra tips :) gonna add it to my best recipe collection"
"0","4","My hubby and my in-laws loved the cake. Its so simple and so quick. I normally dont like to cook, but this simple and easy recipe made me enter the kitchen. I added a cup of walnuts to the batter. It was delicious."
"0","5","So simple and amazing. Really great when you have limited items in the house and need to whip something up fast!"
"0","4","It was easy, but needs more flavor. I miht try it with some brown sugar or make it into more of a spice cake next time."
"0","5","Just pulled these outta the oven. They are awesome! Not the best I have had but I will DEF make them again!!"
"0","2","I followed the recipe almost exactly and I had to triple the milk to even get the batter to not be like cookie dough. Basically it was cornbread like, had way too much vanilla and not enough other flavor besides that. I don't know. It was dense and a PAIN to clean. I won't be making this one again. Sorry. :("
"0","5","It's sunday night and my husband wants a cake. This was perfect, hit the spot, easy for me to make and moist and yummy! Taste good even without icing! I did add extra milk, 3/4 cup. My 15yr old son even told me I was the best while he was eating it!"
"0","4","I was looking for a quick cake recipe and this one hit the jackpot. I made dessert cups for strawberry shortcake and was very pleased with the outcome."
"0","4","I love all your recipes. I use them alot this recipes work really well with nuts and fruit Thanks. Keep it up"
"0","5","Awesome, and so easy!!!!!!! I substituted brown sugar for white n it gave a nice caramelly taste"
"0","4","I made cupcakes for the first time tonight following this recipe. I took other reviewers' suggestions and beat the heck out of every single step with an electric mixer on max. I also used 3/4 cup of milk + 1 TBS of vanilla extract + a bit of almond extract. Baked for 20 min. The cake tastes very good - light and fluffy and very eggy. However, it's still a little dry for my taste even with the extra milk. Next time I will either add even more milk, or reduce the baking time/temp."
"0","5","very good, I even ate it without frosting. I didn't change the recipe at all, used an 8x8 pan and baked for 35 min. I can see why this would be very good as cupcakes, no crumbs at all. I will definately keep this and make again."
"0","4","i dont know if was because i bakes in an little electric oven but they had a dump in the midle not nice at all for decorating but the flavor is good! maybe they needed some extra liquid cause i made some rainbow ones and obviously i added drops of colouring and those came out ok but still flat so , i was hoping for a cupcake with a rounded top"
"0","5","AWESOME SOUNDS DELIOUS"
"0","5","My daughter made cupcakes for a friend's birthday, and they turned out perfect! We used evaporated cane juice instead of sugar. This will be our new vanilla cupcake recipe!"
"0","3","I love the flavor, but it is dry. I have tried it a couple of times, tried underbaking, adding the extra milk, to help with dryness, but just can't seem to moisten it up. Maybe next time will try adding some oil."
"0","5","i cant belive i made these been making it for sometime now and every times it comes out fantastic.the only thing i did was baking for 15 mins"
"0","4","I work at a preschool and I baked this recipe with my kids. We made cupcakes instead of cake. It worked out great."
"0","5","Simple great cake, did use 3/4 c milk like others suggested. Was actually better than white cake recipes that were way more involved! also you don't have to seperate the egg whites!"
"0","5","I made this recipe as cupcakes for my kids' bday parties and they were a hit! Kids AND adults loved them! I also made a few changes - a bit more sugar (1.5 cups) and vanilla extract (2.5 tsps). I will definitely bake this again! Very simple and tasty."
"0","5","I'm trying to cut down on white sugar and this recipe turned out great using 3/4C of maple syrup(instead of white sugar)and 1/3c of milk. Really moist and none of my kids noticed any substitution, this is definitely a keeper at my house. Try to use room temperature maple syrup though because mine was cold and it was hard to cream it with the butter!"
"0","5","Made as written, beating the ever loving heck out of it as others suggest. Tastes like sugar cookie!"
"0","1","I made these as cupcakes. I followed all the recommendations to cream the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. They still turned out very dry and heavy."
"0","2","Not a very good...cake browned too much on the outside and undercooked somewhat on the inside - not horrible tasting, just not very good. Very Very heavy cake - I would not use this recipe again."
"0","4","this is a good recipe and its easy! you really have to follow the instructions and add a bit more milk but its good."
"0","2","The cake tasted so-so and had a somewhat gritty texture."
"0","5","simple, easy to make and so yummy and fluffy."
"0","4","great texture, thick slightly dense, not too crumbly, tastes like a sugar cookie. I gave it four stars because it does need an extra 1/2 c or so of milk and it is not a true white cake more of a yellow cake"
"0","5","Amazing, best cupckaes I have ever made!"
"0","2","Not a great tasting cake. I followed reviewers advice and used 3/4 cup milk, and the cupcakes were very moist, but they tasted bland/floury. My husband said they almost tasted like cornbread. Probably won't use this recipe again."
"0","4","I have made these as cupcakes twice. Nice and light. I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk. I took the advice of a previous review and beat the final batter until it had the consistancy of thick whipping cream then spooned it into the cups."
"0","4","I like these cupcakes. However, I prefer more of a moist buttermilk texture. I will probably adjust the recipe to my preference, but will make again."
"0","5","this is the best white cake recipe i've found to date. added a little extra milk per the previous reviews. excellent."
"0","5","Great cake! I used a stand mixer and let my sugar and butter cream until fluffy (about 2 mins on low-med). Then mixed each egg for about 30 secs on med-low. It was an extremely fluffy mix before adding the remaining ingredients. I did make subsitutions for allergies, golden shortening and rice milk. Also slightly increased the vanilla and rice milk. The batter was deliciously smooth and thick. I had to spread it in the pan with a spatula."
"0","5","I love this cake it is easy delicious cake"
"0","2","This cake was o.k. Nothing to write home about. A quick fix to a cake craving. It lacks on flavor though. I suggest a very sweet icing. I made a brown sugar sauce which helped with flavoring and moistened the cake nicely. I doubt that I will make this cake again."
"0","3","Good, but, definitely did not wow me."
"0","5","so yummy! everyone loved it...even my sister who was scared when she found out i was making a cake from scratch. I took other's advise and added more milk than called for. worked out beautifully :O)"
"0","3","I was looking for something super quick and this was it. If you are looking for an amazing white cake then you have to put the time into it but I was just looking for something to satisfy my sweet craving. I found the recipe at 2:00 and had to pick up my kids at 2:30. By 2:40, we were all enjoying a wonderful after school treat. I did not change the recipe. I whipped up some cream with NO SUGAR added and then but a few colorful sugar sprinkles on the top for the kids. I think this cake is perfect for the busy mom. Kids are happy with anything sweet and I can rest assured that it was wholesome and unprocessed. I have to admit that I was in a huge hurry and used 'Country Crock' instead of butter. This cake is a good base for other toppings such as whipped cream, fruit, pudding, jello, etc. 3 stars for overall taste and texture but 5 stars for easy, satisfying and no complaints from my family!"
"0","2","Not sure if I did something wrong. Cake has decent flavor but ended up denser than I wanted. I had to add extra milk as many people mentioned, the batter consistency was closer to cookie dough before that. Not a terrible recipe but not the one for me."
"0","3","When I made this cake I found that it did not have a very nice flavor even though I followed the recipe exactly. I used a 9 inch baking tin and it only yielded about half the size of what a 9inch cake usually yields. It is not too light, actually it is slightly dense. I will continue looking for other white cake recipes."
"0","4","Very good recipe for a simple and easy white cake. I added an extra 1/4 c milk as suggested by other reviews, but I think another 1/4 c might be better. Mine was still could be a bit more moist. But that is a personal preference. I think that if you have kids this is the perfect recipe!"
"0","5","Loved it! Cake came out moist and delicious! Did add a bit more milk, but nothing else!"
"0","4","It IS very simple. Tastes good."
"0","4","This was really easy to bake, but did taste a little plain. Thanks!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. I have made it several times, with a slight variation to the recipe. quarter cup less sugar and quarter cup more milk. Almond extract goes great in this recipe as well, When cooled i sprikled a bit of powder sugar for that extra slight sweetness. It is soo tasty kids dont leave a crumb behind."
"0","5","I'm giving this recipe five starts because it was the PERFECT base for the treat I wanted to make. My kids are home from school because of the snow, and we all decided it would be great to make some Jello 'poke cake' in cupcake form. I didn't have any box mixes on hand, and made this recipe instead. After reading the reviews, I made sure to give the batter plenty of time to mix at each stage. I also added a bit of extra milk. The cupcakes were done in 20 minutes, at which point I poked several holes in each cupcake. I mixed a package of lemon Jello with 1 cup boiling water and poured some of it over each cupcake. I refrigerated the cupcakes until they were completely chilled, carefully removed them from the pan and peeled the paper liners off, then dusted them with powdered sugar. They were FANTASTIC. This recipe was perfect since I only had one box of jello (using a box mix makes more and you'd need two boxes of Jello) and can't get out to the store. Unfortunately I can't comment on this recipe as-is, but for what I needed today it was exactly right. Yum!"
"0","4","This recipe was really easy to make. The cake tastes fine, but not great. It did taste a little like cornbread, but not as bad as other white cake recipes I have tried. I'm going to keep looking for the perfect white cake recipe, but I'll hang on to this one too."
"0","4","Simple and quick! I did add 1/4C more milk because the batter was very thick and I'm glad I did because the cupcakes were on the dry side still. Had a very good taste! Thanks for the recipe"
"0","4","I made this cake exactly as described and it turned out really well for me. It was super quick and easy and used the ingredients I had on hand. I ended up getting 16 cupcakes instead of the 12 stated. It wasn't the most amazing cake I ever tasted, but it was good enough, and I will definitely make this again."
"0","4","I really liked this cake. I am allergic to cane sugar, so I used honey instead. It turned out pretty dense, more like a pound cake, but it was still very good."
"0","2","These were ok, but not that great. I increased the milk as some suggested, but should have also increased the sugar as they ended up not being very sweet."
"0","4","Came out great. Made some strawberry butter cream icing! I will add a little more sugar next time. Great recipe overall!"
"0","4","i followed others' suggestions and used 3/4 cup milk, but other than that i kept everything the same. i think they tasted great, and in fact tasted even better a couple days later. they were very easy to make. with most recipies, i am left with a lot more batter than the serving size called for but this gave me enough for exactly 12 cupcakes. keep in mind that although they aren't as yellow as most other cakes, they aren't a pure white color. i might use only egg whites next time to achieve that."
"0","5","Great and simple"
"0","4","I used this recipe to make my son's 3rd birthday cake. I added a 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/2 tsp of salt and baked it in a 9x13 pan. it turned out perfect! I don't agree that it has a cornbread texture....mine was light and fluffy. I did beat it really well with my mixer, so maybe that helped. this is a great simple recipe. thanks for it! so much better than out of a box!"
"0","5","Just as the title suggests...a simple white cake. My cupcakes came out great. Yum! It is a dense cake...not dry and crumbly but not a really moist cake either."
"0","4","I tried this recipe as a quick after dinner dessert. I was very pleased how easy it was. The only change that I made was using self-rising flour instead. I added 2 tbs extra also and it turned out great."
"0","5","really delicious! not very sweet but satisfying."
"0","4","I used two 8' round cake pans and after 25 minutes the cake was dry so I I'll try a shorter bake-time next time. However, the flavor was very good. Instead of 2 T of vanilla, I did 1 T vanilla and 1 T almond extract. Delicious!"
"0","5","My white cake now!!!! Thanks a lot!!!!"
"0","5","i made this cake for school (3 layers) it was all gone in less then half an hour sooo good we also got an 90% for the project so if that dosen't say something i don't know what will."
"0","4","I found the taste and texture to be more like that of a breakfast muffin or a coffee cake, rather than a cupcake. Not overly sweet, not very fluffy, but not too dense. I think I'll try using it as jumping off point to create some muffin recipes."
"0","5","totally yum! They are not too sweet and sorta have a cornbread taste to them. Thanks for the great recipe."
"0","4","I made this cake for the Tiramisu Layer Cake recipe on this site and it worked perfectly. I made it the night before I assembled the cake and it was a bit dry but I think it was my fault. The flavor was great and I'll definitely use it again."
"0","5","Really tasty and moist! :D"
"0","5","This recipe was amazing! Very easy to follow and very tasty :)"
"0","4","I was just so-so on the taste, but my brother seemed to love it. I did love the simplicity of making it though!"
"0","5","This receipe was easy to make and delicous. Instead of milk a used buttermilk for added flavor."
"0","5","a perfect easy white cake. My 3 yr old thinks everything needs to be techno color so we used food coloring to make this cake blue. That made it even more fun to eat."
"0","5","I think these came out perfectly! I made sure to cream the sugar and butter until fluffy and also did the same with the eggs. They are a more dense cake, but not too heavy in the least and have a wonderful flavor. Delicious!"
"0","2","I just didn't like the way it tasted. I was disappointed as it is a highly rated recipe. I will stick to my Magnolia's cupcake recipe."
"0","3","These cupcakes were easy to make and not too sweet which is great if you choose to frost them, but they were a little dry."
"0","5","Easy and very tasty! Light and tasty. I frosted mine with chocolate frosting and sprinkles and they turned out great."
"0","4","I didn't really care for the way this cake tasted, but every one else LOVED it. I made this as a cake for my mother's birthday and filled it with a Lemon Cream recipe I also found on this site. It was so easy that I had my 6 year old help. Instead of AP flour, I used cake flour, I'm going to try it again with all purpose flour and perhaps a more mellow frosting. I was told that it tasted like the cakes my grandma used to make, but I really didn't taste it. To me, it tasted like a cakey biscuit almost. 4 stars cause THEY loved it."
"0","4","I thought this was a good, really easy to make cake recipe. Was it the best cake I've ever eaten? No, but it was really good and super simple to make. I used margarine instead of butter, and added sprinkles to make 'funfetti' cupcakes. This recipe is a keeper in my house."
"0","5","This cake is perfect for kids birthday cakes that you are piping with a buttercream or decorators icing. I use it all the time and have had many compliments on its taste and texture."
"0","3","I liked that is was ez But it's missing something for me ...My daughter on the other loves it. I like my cakes a lil more moist and light. But it's good . Thanks for sharing"
"0","4","I made this the other night just as an experience and it turned out AMAZING. my family loved it. my husband and I thought it was a little thick, but my mother in law said it had the consistency of a wedding cake so her and my father in law both loved it. I'm making it again for a birthday cake."
"0","3","I followed user reviews' suggestions and added more milk to my recipe when I used this to make cupcakes for my daughter's birthday. I dont know why, but mine still turned out pretty dry. I know they would have been tasty if they were a little more moist and fluffy because they had a good flavor. Maybe I was cooking them too long, but I kept checking to see if the cake sprung back to the touch and it was. So I dont know what I did wrong."
"0","4","This was a tasty recipe, however, it really is more of a wedding cake than a delicious light cupcake. I had hoped for a substitue a boxed cake but taste too much like cornbread minus the corn, lol but good non-the-less"
"0","4","These are pretty good. They have almost a cornbread texture on the top (which i hid with yummy frosting). So make sure you mix well. My guests said they were the best cupcakes they have ever had.So i guess the best cupcakes dont have to be terribly fancy."
"0","5","This was super! The recipe was e-z and everyone loved it! It was pretty dense though, and it didn't rise much, but I was using bad baking powder. So, when making this recipe, use new, fresh, soft baking powder and you'll have the best cake or muffins ever!"
"0","1","This is the first time I tried making these after weeks of debating. My cupcakes came out very dense. Don't know what I did wrong."
"0","5","I made a cake for my child's birthday. She doesn't like chocolate or any other flavor. She only likes vanilla. I used this recipe and she loved it! I love this recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious cake! Moist and fluffly but held up well to being iced. I filled my cupcakes with a strawberry cream filling. I will definately make this again!"
"0","4","I made cupcakes with this recipe twice. The first time they were very good but rather dry. The second time I added more milk and vanilla and they were better."
"0","5","Good moist cake. Easy and fast. I already had all the ingredients. My family ate it up and I didn't even frost it!"
"0","5","I absolutely love this cake! It's easy to make and tastes great! Thanks for it!"
"0","5","Super yummy and easy to make! It is a dense cake but moist. I did put 3/4 cup of milk and like another reviewer said...'Beat the heck out of each step!' Happy baking!"
"0","3","Followed the recipe as posted and found the cake to be very dense and dry. Don't know what I did wrong but it definitely didn't spring back when it was done. I will try it again but with adding the extra milk as many others have suggested."
"0","5","followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the milk; i added milk till i was happy with the mixture consistency. the cake was beautiful!"
"0","5","This is awesome...had some last minute 'birthday guests' and no time to run to the store...Just what I was looking for~!"
"0","4","This was a very easy cake to make. I added 1/4 cup more milk as advised by many other reviewers and used brown sugar because I didn't have any white. It came out really yummy, with a very slight cornbread-ish texture, but not enough to ruin the recipe. Just follow the directions carefully and you will have a great cake."
"0","5","Wow! The perfect vanilla cupcake! So good with vanilla icing...thanks for the recipe!"
"0","3","i thought it was heavy and dry."
"0","4","Okay maybe this is for cup cakes only. I listened to the suggestions, the extra milk and beating well. What a mess! The cake fell apart, I guess a cup cake is held together by the muffing cup. Will never make this again!!!!! UPDATE 8/20. I placed the cake in the fridge and served the next day. Well I was wrong the cake firmed up nicely, it was moist without crumbling. So I changed the rating from 1 to 4. Next time I will allow to cool in the fridge before removing from the pan."
"0","5","Super easy! Super yummy! And I didn't change a thing. :)"
"0","5","This is a great recipe; I made cupcakes. I ran out of vanilla extract and used fresh lime juice instead. I grated a little lime zest into the batter as well. Yum!!"
"0","5","I have to change my review on this cake now that I am using 3/4 cup of milk. I highly suggest the reciep is changed to reflect the many reviews that say to use more milk. I also freeze these for at least 2 days before I use them. They are so good, I always get a lot of compliments on them."
"0","3","This recipe was ok. I took other reviewer's advice, beating well, adding a little extra milk. It was not a bad cake, but definitely not the best."
"0","5","Awesome recipe!First time making it and it turned out perfect.Would make it again for sure!!!!"
"0","5","Wow what a wonderful recipe. I never was one for baking but I love easy. I added 1/4 cup more milk and about a small amount of sugar. Love love love with home made buttercream icing and toasted coconut yummy"
"0","3","I used this recipe to make cupcakes. I didn't love the texture or even the taste. Wasn't bad but I've had much better so I won't be using this recipe again."
"0","3","it turned out dry and crumbly ..."
"0","5","This is the easiest recipe when you have a sweet tooth or your in a pinch. It took me all but 20mins from mixing to baking and the cake was really light and fluffy. I really enjoyed this."
"0","3","not sure what i did wrong... followed the recipe to the 't'! and my cupcakes deflated... they don't have a round top.... i also made another batch at the same time, but used rice flour instead.. those came out great! also i used agave syrup instead of sugar for both recipes... one came out great the other not so great."
"0","3","I made this the other day & it was just ok to me."
"0","2","This cake was very easy to make. Although it was not sweet enough for my taste. The next day it did taste more like pound cake."
"0","4","I'm usually try to cook my family some treats here and there and this has been one of their favorites, good job simple and easy for everyone."
"0","4","i made this cake today we doubled it and we put in extra milk and it came out good"
"0","5","I made the cake and it was easy...but it was a bit dry...great cake to make cupcakes with...add icing perfect!! I loved it thanks"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly....and ended up with a batch of delicious cupcakes!!!"
"0","3","I made this for a 9x9 birthday cake, and it had too much vanilla flavoring. For such a small size it produces, i'd cut the vanilla to 1 tsp. Someone asked if I had made a mistake in the measurement, so I know it wasn't just me. Like someone also said, it's very dense, like your typical wedding cake. I'll keep looking for another recipe."
"0","5","I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday, and it was a big hit. I did find it a bit dense--but this was no problem for my daughter's friends and guests. Will make again."
"0","5","I really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for a simple and tasty white cake and this was it! I actually made some substitutions as I did not have all ingredients on hand, and it still was great! I substituted the butter for canola oil and used maple extract in place of the vanilla extract. To add to the maple appeal, I garnished this with a bit of icing and toasted pecans. Wonderful!"
"0","4","Okay one great cake.If you follow this recipe to the T,your a ok!I did,and it was great with cream cheese frosting.Def. making these again,and I will reccomend these to people looking for a good cake/cupcake.I made cupcakes,Spongebob,lol!"
"0","5","I only had 2 eggs in the house and my box cake required 3, so I got on the computer and found this great recipe! It came out 'white' inside and was very moist and yummy. Since we live at approx. 4,500 feet in elevation, I had to change the recipe. I used 3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup flour plus 2 level TBSP, and only 1 1/2 tsp baking powder. I also used 3/4 cup milk like the other reviewers suggested. I did beat it constantly. Even when adding flour and the milk at the end. It made 13 cupcakes and they look so great. I do think the key is to mix very well or else the batter it is gritty because of the sugar. This is a super mix to keep on hand in a pinch! Thank you..."
"0","3","this cake was not as fluffy as i wanted.but will do in a pinch.i used whip cream to garnish and fresh fruit."
"0","5","This is awsome! it does taste just like a very good sugar cookie my kid and i made this and we couldnt get our hands off them once they were done! my husband absolutely loved them too.(we made cup cakes) I will defenetly be making this again!"
"0","4","I liked this cake. I thought it had nice flavor and texture. I did add a pinch of salt."
"0","5","Love this cake. Very light and moist."
"0","5","A very easy, very good cake. It isn't too sweet, which was great. I used a 9 inch round cake to make for my son's toy's 'birthday party'. I will definitely be making it again. I did use a bit extra milk and mixed everything a lot after each addition."
"0","5","Easy and tasty!"
"0","5","Wonderful for Cupcake Cake -- Cupcakes shaped into a design and frosted to look like a cake. The kids AND the parents loved these with my fresh strawberry butter cream icing. I promise to post the icing soon."
"0","3","this had a good taste. but its to dense."
"0","5","I'm rewriting this review but the rating stays the same. This cake has been my 'go to' recipe for birthdays and special occasions. Everyone always raves about this cake. I make it as written with the exception that I reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. I don't add the extra milk. The first time I made this I whisked it by hand till creamy, resulting in a delicious, golden, crumbly cake. Since then, I have used my electric mixer and beat the sugar/egg mixture till creamy (sometimes a few minutes, sometimes 8-10 minutes depending on time), resulting in the wonderful white cake as described in the title. I also find that this cake tastes better the next day and is relatively moist (but it wouldn't hurt to moisten it a bit more), but it should be used up within less than a week. The square shape is great for kids' birthday parties, which can be easily cut into 12 or 16 pieces, and the round shape is elegant for the older crowd, such as weddings, baptisms, b-days, etc. By no means am I a cake expert but this is what I have experienced with this recipe (so far). It is definitely a keeper, though! Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for a quick and easy cake mix. This tastes great so much better than the boxed stuff. I added food coloring to it this time. Does not help out with the taste....i would not recommend."
"0","4","this is an amazing cake ! I made it for my mother and she loved it, so did everyone else who tried it. I added a little bit more vanilla for flavor. It got 4 stars because I couldn't get it out of the pan at all. I made it twice, it stuck both times, with a greased and floured pan, but oh well, it was amazing anyway!"
"0","4","Awesome!! My family loved it and it was soooo quick and easy to make. I had it mixed and out of the oven before my kids were finished with bathtime! Only next time I will try with cake flour to see what that does!"
"0","5","Right now I am in the middle of making a 6 layer circle cake using this recipe.. It is wonnnnderful! I have another batch in the oven and it came out perfect! The consistency of the finished cake is perfect for carving and being able to move around without worrying about it falling apart but at the same time is it a delicious cake. Thanks so much!!"
"0","5","I iced the cake with a cream cheese frosting recipe and served warm. This is a simple recipe that is easily made with items typically on hand. I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed."
"0","4","This was pretty good. It was a dense cake but I served it with strawberries and cool whip, so the texture worked just fine."
"0","2","This was easy to make but was too sweet and too dense. Wouldn't use it again."
"0","4","This cake is very easy to make. It is as good as everyone says. Make it a day or two early though. I thought the reviewers were crazy when this cake came out of the oven. It was bland and crumbly. The next day it was tender and and delicious."
"0","5","This made awesome cupcakes!! It was not dense at all--nice and fluffy!! I made sure the cream the butter/sugar really well and then beat the eggs in like crazy. I didn't do 8-10 min as previous review suggested... probably 2min on the butter/sugar and 2-3 minutes on the egg. I frosted them with the Chocolate Frosting II recipe from this site. GREAT!!"
"0","4","This was not what we thought it was going to be...We beat it like crazy for at least 10 mins and added extra milk like others said. It turned out more like a giant flat cookie. Dont plan on making this again. ** I wrote this before i tried it and it was WAY better then it looked...if i plan on making a big cookie i will make this recipe again :)we drizzled it with chocolate and butterscotch and it was perfect."
"0","4","I made this before reading the reviews so didn't make any changes. It was extremely simple and the family loved it. I made it with the banana butter frosting. My step daughter said 5 stars - hubby said 3 so I went with my vote which was 4 stars. It was dense, but moist and very tasty."
"0","5","this recipe is fantastic! i like to try out recipes during the hols.this one came out incredibly light and fluffy!following the other reviewers' comments i added some more milk.i recommend this recipe if you are looking for an easy and simple cake. thank you!"
"0","5","This is a great family cake. I made it for a quick dessert and it was delicious, I reccomend a regular white frosting put on 5 minutes after the cake gets out of teh oven. It melts slightly leaving a delicious taste. Mmmmmmmm..."
"0","4","I made this cake today,its not a wow! recipe but it tastes good and i recommend it if you want something simple.I used buttercream frosting and fresh strawberries,no complaints."
"0","4","This was a delicious cake and very easy to make! The only reason for just 4 stars is the top bubbled up quite a bit and I had to cut off some of the top to make it even. Plus I am glad I checked it after 30 minutes because the sides were starting to burn. Overall though very yummy and extremely simple!"
"0","5","My kids were actually preferring to eat the cake rather than the icing! I usually tweak recipes a bit, but this one is perfect as it! Great find THanks!"
"0","5","Its on the heavy side. It definately needs extra liquid to make it easier to pour into the cupcake pan."
"0","5","This recipe makes great cupcakes! Its my new go-to cupcake recipe. I don't change it one bit and the cakes always turn out light and perfectly flavored. I like a simple white frosting on them but recently tried a chocolate frosting and it was pretty good."
"0","4","I have made this recipe twice so far. It was a tad bit dry but it was really tastey :-)"
"0","1","Cake is way too heavy (very much like cornbread and impossible to frost)! I did not care for this recipe."
"0","5","This cake is delicious. I used 3/4 cup of milk, and it came out perfect."
"0","5","the easiest homemade cake bread and so moist and delicious!!!!"
"0","5","Great cake base! I used brown sugar for these rather than white (always brown for me). Instead of milk, I used a cup of buttermilk and added a little bit extra vanilla. I added some shredded cocounut in the mixture as I was making coconut cupcakes and everything turned out great! I will definitely be using this recipe for all my cake bases! It was moist and a nice medium of being fluffy and dense. I keep the cupcakes in the fridge then pop em in the microwave for 20 seconds and it's just like being fresh out of the oven again, yum!"
"0","2","This was dry and tasteless."
"0","3","This was very tasty, but kind of crumbly. It actually reminds me of corn bread. I added extra milk like everyone has said, of course I can't compare it with having not added extra milk."
"0","5","Awesome cake for Strawberry Short Cake!"
"0","5","I wish I could give more than 5 stars! This cake was delicious. I used it for cupcakes and I used chocolate buttercream, way better than publix or anywhere else. I loved it! Im making another batch today :)"
"0","4","more of a simple yellow cake, my husband said it tasted like pancakes. I frosted with lemon cream cheese frosting which is very flavorful, so i guess this cake recipe made a good, plain base for the frosting."
"0","4","With the addition of the 1/4 c. milk, it was a five star cake! It has a soft, dense texture that would be comparable to a wedding cake. Make sure to take everyone's advice and make sure to beat the eggs well-- it was worth the time!"
"0","3","They work in a pinch, easy with the kids, but more like a soft sugar cookie than a white cupcake (or compared to a box mix, anyway). Probably won't make them again."
"0","5","This is my go to recipe for cupcakes. It never fails me."
"0","4","This recipe makes great cupcakes. I have tried it a few times now and they are lovely and fluffy. However the recipe never quite makes the required amount. Do extra."
"0","5","Really simple. Requires only a few of the basics, so you don't have to run to the store to get missing ingredients. Made this for my little ones birthday.... Really impressed. Tastes really good."
"0","5","Yummy! Made for my son's 1st b-day and it was just perfect. added 2 Tbsps of milk and 2 Tbsps of sprinkles to the batter for a confetti cake."
"0","3","I liked the taste of the cake but the texture was a little heavy. I used the extra 1/4 cup of milk, upped the vanilla to a full tablespoon, and beat everything together very well. I baked in a 9 inch round cake pan for 25 minutes. Baked perfectly but we just didn't like the texture. It does taste really good with the extra vanilla in it."
"0","5","It's so simple and delicious. Partner with the vanilla frosting (photo has 25th anniv. cake). Stellar!"
"0","5","I was craving cake and wanted something simple to make. This was easy and I already had all the ingredients on hand. I love plain vanilla cake and it came out perfectly (substituted vegetable oil and soy milk for butter and milk)."
"0","5","This cake was so easy and SO FORGIVING. I entirely messed up and added milk twice. Luckily I realized in time, mixed up another batch of the dry ing./egg mix and made two cakes. Both cakes came out fantastic. Used a molded cake tin and frosted with ganache topped with shaved chocolate and a bit of red sugar for Valentine's day."
"0","4","Really simple and easy to make. Had a cupcake craving and no cake mix, so I tried this recipe. It lacks a bit of moisture but is in no way terrible."
"0","5","This was great. My husband loved it and so did I. It was easy to make."
"0","5","I would like to rename the cake: sugar cookie cake. FANTASTIC. Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site."
"0","4","This was a very good recipe after I added the honey like Kelly had mentioned. By the way, I love the rainbow frosting, I would love to know how you did that!"
"0","3","I agree with other posters that this is a Yellow cake, not white. I also had the same issue others had with it falling apart and being crumbly. I followed the recipe as is, so it is probably best to add the additional milk that is suggested by other posters. The taste was pretty good, but it's extremely hard to eat a cupcake that falls apart on you when you take the wrapper off."
"0","2","I thought It was bland, but that's just me."
"0","2","This cake was very dense. Sorry, didn't like it at all."
"0","5","I have never made a 'scratch' cake - Ok . . .this is what a cake should taste like - old school - yum. It was easy to follow and I had all the ingredients in the fridge, pantry etc - no need to go to the supermarket prior to making the cake. I used the 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' which put the cake over the top in terms of how amazing it is."
"0","5","This is the best cake I ever made. Very moist and delicious. I plan to use it over and over."
"0","4","Good flavor, easy to make. Not fine in texture, but tender. I followed other post's advice to add milk so I used 3/4 cup total. Everything else, I followed the recipe. Thanks for sharing your recipe :)"
"0","4","I used this recipe for cupcakes and my husband said they were the best cupcakes he's ever had in his life! Very high praise. Since I liked them but didn't completely love them, I'm giving them 4 stars. I did make sure to cream the butter and sugar for 8 minutes and then beat for an additional minute after adding each egg. I also added 1/4 cup of milk. They were still a little dry, although they had a nice texture anyway. I would definitely use this recipe again. It made 30 cupcakes for me."
"0","4","SO EASY and so delicious. I made the cupcake version of this and followed the recipe exactly—I couldn't be happier with the way it turned out."
"0","5","made cupcakes and they came out great. I added 1/4 cup of milk and mixed the butter a lot."
"0","3","This cake was ok, but it is not a white cake. It's a yellow cake. I make it twice. The first time, it was missing something and I couldn't figure out what it was. Two tsp of vanilla ought to be plenty for a small cake like this. Then I made it again the next day (for the second layer) and realized that there is no salt in the recipe. I added a scant 1/2 tsp and it was much better, but still a little bland. Per other reviews, I added a little more milk than called for, and it was moist enough and pretty dense, which was what I was after. As a general rule, when creaming butter and sugar, I add them to the mixer, turn it on and leave it while I grease and flour my pans. Usually, that gives the sugar and butter plenty of time to get nice and fluffy."
"0","5","All the great reviews are on target. This cake is easy and really good."
"0","2","Did not care for the flavor or texture of this cake."
"0","5","First time I attempted a cake from scratch and turned out EXCELLENT!!!Easy to follow recipe i added some blueberries mixed them in mmmmm good!!! Will definately make again Thank you"
"0","1","Yuk, I added 1/4 cup additional milk and an additional tbsp of vanilla. Otherwise I followed the directions to a 'T'. I don't see how this recipe received anything higher than two stars. It was awful. I'm a pretty good baker, but this, this I won't ever make again. It was dry and tasted like plain egg yolk."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Quick and good! Their going to be perfect the strawberries and whipped cream tonight!"
"0","5","This is a perfect sized smaller cake recipe and it is moist. I added a tablespoon of almond extract and sprinkled powder sugar on the top after it was finished baking."
"0","3","it was ok..."
"0","3","This was pretty good. It does taste a little like corn bread without the graininess. Was much better with some icing too. Good for a starter recipe."
"0","5","This cake was great! I beat the heck out of it between each step as other reviewers recommended (which was task considering I did it by hand--but totally worth it), and added cinnamon to the batter at the end. I baked it in a bunt cake pan bc that's all I had. I topped it with 'vanilla glaze' recipe from this site. Sooo good, I'll def make again."
"0","3","kids liked it but my husband and I thought it could use a little more flavor"
"0","5","I baked this for my birthday, and it came out perfectly! Very tasty and just right."
"0","1","This cake was definitely a letdown. I followed the recipe and user comments EXACTLY, adding more milk, and making sure i creamed the butter and sugar and then the eggs until they were light and fluffy. I was a little hesitant pouring the batter in, considering it was quite heavy. The result was pretty much a thick sugar cookie cake with absolutely no flavor. Yuck. I tried to salvage the cake by making it into a trifle with some pudding and cool whip and fruits but it didnt fool anyone. I wont be making this again."
"0","4","super easy and really yummy"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe and made cupcakes. They came out perfect - great texture and great taste."
"0","5","This made the best cupcakes I have ever had. Perfectly fluffy; not too sweet. I made half the recipe with chocolate chips mixed in, and half just as written. Absolute perfection. I had a yield of 14 cupcakes"
"0","5","Really good recipe. I did reduce the sugar 1/2 cup and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp . Kids love it. i will be making this again."
"0","5","Really good!! Followed the directions exactly. Recommend highly."

"0","4","This is a wonderful cake recipe but do not be fooled, egg yolks=yellow cake. I would describe this recipe as a pound cake, not white. Very good cake all the same."
"0","4","Cake was good but was a little too sweet for me, next time i will cut it back to 1/2 cup-3/4 cup sugar"
"0","4","This cake turned out really great. After reading some of the other reviews, I too added a little extra milk. I also decided to add a few spoonfulls of sour cream. My cake turned out super moist and was really tasty. I'll definately do this again."
"0","5","My family loved this cake!!!"
"0","5","love this recepts i made it and turn out really good and not to golden maybe less time next time i make them but really good"
"0","5","I raised the milk and the vanilla just like everyone else and it turned out GREAT"
"0","5","I've been looking for a cupcake recipe for a long time. I haven't made cupcakes homemade yet. This recipe was so easy it was unbelievable. The first person to try it was my 14 year step son. He couldn't believe how good it was and had to have another one. Thanks for the best cupcakes I've had in a long time."
"0","4","I'm not if I did something wrong but my cake was a little dry for my taste."
"0","5","I was searching for a simple white cake recipe that didn't require many eggs (my hens aren't laying much at this time of year and I refuse to buy any more pallid looking store bought, fake free range, vegetarian fed eggs). So glad I found this one. I took someone's advice and added 1/4 cup more milk to it and then had enough batter for two small cake pans. Added a touch of almond extract also in addition to the vanilla. My husband was very pleased with the result. You see, I used this recipe to make a birthday cake."
"0","5","I just made this recipe gluten free by substituting a gluten-free flour mix for the cake flour. It is fantastic and simple. I put it in an 8 x 8 pyrex dish and cooked for approx. 35 minutes. I didn't make any other substitutions."
"0","2","I follwed other users and addd an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I was making a practice run on cupcakes for a baby shower, but think I will stick with the Heavenly White Cake recipe on here that I used for my husband's b-day cake last year. The batter tasted similar to pancake batter, but I thought maybe they would turn out better once cooked. Nope, tasted like pancakes....am planning on giving some to the neighbors for breakfast! Not sure who enjoys pancake cupcakes, but my husband is now calling them the cup-pancakes."
"0","4","i made this cake last night and i guess it was ok..like some other reviewers said it had a cornbread element..i did increase the milk like others suggested but for me it's still not the best white cake i've ever tasted.i also think the cake was a bit too sweet.3/4 cup sugar would be enough."
"0","5","this cake came out very moist and fluffy, i add extra milk(the reviews)and added honey,after cooking it it came out very soft,you can add honey on top and powdered sugar"
"0","5","Easy peasy and oh so good. Added extra water as per suggestions. Extra vanilla too and threw in chopped fresh mcintosh apples and made it in a flan pan so put walnuts, raisins and dried cranberries on top then sprinkled with icing sugar... the reviews were GREAT! and we usually throw away cake as we're not really cake eaters."
"0","5","this is a great recipe , I added little more milk because the batter seemed to be little thick and I did not have vanilla so I added some lemon zest and a few drops of lemon juice and it turned great ."
"0","5","I thought this cake was amazing! I did not have the cornbread effect that others complained of and I did not even beat the heck out of it. I have a hand mixer, so I got tired after only 5 minutes. It still turned out great. This is a dense and heavy cake, but absolutely delicious. It is meant to be eaten quickly because it did want to harden after a day, but I kept it in the fridge to minimize that. I frosted it with Butter cream frosting II from this site. I will make this again and again!!"
"0","3","This might be a better cupcake recipe than a actual cake recipe. I doubled the recipe for a 2 layer cake and I took the suggestions that other people mentioned. I whipped the out of everything butter/sugar mix and each egg got whipped separately. I also added more milk and vanilla. My eggs were even room temp for proper emulsion and the batter looked great. The cake did rise properly (a problem others had mentioned) but it was very dense like poundcake. It had good flavor though and it was totally edible, everyone seemed to like it but it wasn't what i expected. I will try this again using cake flour and do cupcakes instead to see if that makes a difference. If it works then i'll give this a 5 star."
"0","5","This was a really easy cake very simple for my 5 year olds to make. Everything was great I did the extra cream time and the 3/4 cups milk, I didn't butter the pan good enough so some of the cake stuck. It taste awesome...thanks!"
"0","4","This recipe was just what I was looking for. My son wanted to make cupcakes but I didn't have a mix. They came out nice and fluffy and very tasty!"
"0","4","This cake was easy to make and tasted rather nice and looked lovely. However, I did find it was missing that 'something' and was slightly dry."
"0","3","Pretty dry, and turned into cement in a short period of time. But easy to make if you have a sudden craving!"
"0","5","I added some espresso, melted chocolate and some peanuts to the mixture and swirled some Blueberry syrup ontop before i put it in the oven. It was sooo beautiful. Very moist and fluffy."
"0","5","Delicious when you follow the additional instructions provided by Jenn Stavert in her review below. Very moist and just like a cake mix."
"0","5","My boyfriend and I just baked our first cake from scratch. It was so easy and simple and came out great!!! This recipe is awesome and like the other members said, it doesn't hurt to add more vanilla. Loved it, can't wait to bake it again."
"0","5","This cake turned out moist and FLUFFY for me! :) I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the wire whipping attachment and let it go for a bit to incorperate air into the batter.  I made mini cupcakes and frosted with Chocolate Cheese Frosting from this site. It was exactly what I was looking for!! >"
"0","4","Moist and a good base for pretty much anything. Rose well and even, except I think mine were cooked a couple minutes too long because the edges were a tad brittle. Other than that, a good base for almost anything and will keep for the future!"
"0","5","Simple and amazing. Made great cupcakes!"
"0","5","Very easy and versatile - I use this for quick cupcakes or birthday cakes. Crowd pleasing!"
"0","5","I was looking for something simple & easy, this is Yummy! I had only cake & pastry flour in the house so i used it. wow still Yummy! This is the one. Thanks."
"0","5","Very good! Found this recipe last minute when my kids were in the mood for cupcakes. Very simple, easy to follow recipe with ingredients that I always have on hand. The only thing I did different was add a bit more of vanilla as some other reviewers suggested."
"0","5","this cake saved my little girls special day. It was delicious and everyone loved it. another cook on this site recommended this recipe it is a good base cake and taste better than the box. can't wait to try different flavors to make it."
"0","5","This was SO Simple, I am looking for opportunities to do it again! The recipe is enough as it is for a small batch and doubling it is VERY easy. I used this recipe to make a thin 9x12 layered sheet cake for my daughters' 2nd birthday."
"0","5","I made cupcakes and they were perfect just following the recipe as written."
"0","5","My husband says the only thing he doesn't like about this recipe, is that it will be difficult to not eat all the cupcakes in one night!"
"0","5","Made as written. Make 12 cupcakes SO easy."
"0","5","This was a yummy cake. I made it as a bundt cake with the Texas chocolate frosting drizzled over it and it was delicious."
"0","4","this cake tasted really good but it turned out to be a little denser than i like."
"0","5","I just made this recipe to try it out before using it for my son's birthday and it is YUMMY! The cupcakes rose beautifully and were easy to frost. For some of those who had problems with the batter, I recommend using a mixer and slow adding ingredients one at a time while the mixer is running. This includes the flour mixture. I added several spoonfuls at a time until all the flour was completely mixed in and had no problems."
"0","4","I used this as a fill-in for a white cake mix, as I wanted to make the Elvis Presley Cake from this site but discovered I didn't have any cake mix on hand. This was not much more effort to make than a cake mix was, and it tasted better. I didn't change anything in the recipe. It did bake up flat, though. Filled the need I had and worked great in the recipe as a sub. Would probably work better as cupcakes."
"0","3","I personally didn't like this recipe, as the cupcakes I made came out very hard & dry.   Others that tried them enjoyed them greatly. I guess it just matters what the 'customers' want."
"0","5","Don't let the name fool you! It may be simple, but the cake comes out very well and the batter is to die for!"
"0","5","I made the recipe as given except I folded in two cups of fresh blackberries before loading 16 cupcake paper liners 3/4 full. At 20 minutes I checked the 350'F oven and thought they looked underdone. I checked by inserting a wooden toothpick in several cupcakes. It came out clean and the cupcakes came out of the oven. Perfect with many good comments from my friends."
"0","4","I'm revising my original review from '3 and 1/2 stars' to 4 stars. The first time I made this cake it was too much like cornbread. This time I only used 2 egg whites, added 1/4 cup sour cream, used 3 tsp of vanilla extract, and replaced the butter with oil. This is a very dense cake, moist, and easy to frost. NOT FLUFFY. It also rose very nicely. Biggest selling point is the simplicity of this recipe. SUPER SIMPLE and EASY."
"0","5","Super recipe. Great for cupcakes. So easy to make with few ingredients. Turned out great. Nice flavor and texture."
"0","4","I found this to be a standard white cake, which I guess the name already suggests. I made both a loaf cake and cupcakes from this recipe. The loaf cake turned out better texture wise, I found the cupcakes to be a little crumbly. I made the cupcakes for kids though and they all seem to enjoy them. This recipe makes 12 large cupcakes, I had to mix another batch of batter for the cake."
"0","3","usually I don't leave comments for recipes but this one deserves it was simple , easy to make I recommend to add some chocolate pieces  when it melts inside your cupcake , is goooooooooooooooooooooooooood!"
"0","5","Everyone that has one loves these cupcakes!!! I am too afraid to try it without a cup of milk though...sorry :[ The vanilla was poured rather than measured..for good measure. GREAT CUPCAKES!!!!! Yee!!! Have made it a couple of times now and will refer to it as my non-choc cake recipe from now on. Who knew cake could be so much fun?!?!?"
"0","5","I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was a hit, this is a keeper but next time I will substitute the butter for soy oil to cut down the fat."
"0","5","My 9 yr daughter just told me at 7 o'clock at night that her class was having a 'End of the Year Party' tomorrow and she wanted to take cupcakes. I didn't have a cake mix one in the house and was in total pantic until I found this recipe. It was so fluffy, light and had a wonderful taste. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. You saved the day!!"
"0","5","This really is a simple white cake... It took minutes to prepare and turned out great. I used half the sugar and it still turned out fine. I did use my mixer and really beat the eggs and the batter, it filled with air bubbles and resembled yellow whip cream. The end result was light and fluffy cupcakes that iced fantastic. I will definitely make again!! Thanks for the recipe"
"0","5","Very simple to make and really taste good! Not too sweet and really moist. Served with cream cheese icing on top and everybody keeps asking for it! thanks!"
"0","2","I made this cake for a very special occasion and, on its own, was very disappointed in it. It was one of the driest cakes I've ever tasted. The only thing that saved it was the amazing frosting I used (see butter cream frosting II). Because the frosting was so good, no one else really noticed how dry the cake itself was!"
"0","5","This recipe rocks! It reminds me of the cake my gram made when I was a kid. I made it for my mom as an I love you cake and she raved about it."
"0","5","Love this recipe. Make cupcakes for Easter. Adult and kids loved them and asked for more."
"0","3","These weren't what I was hoping for. They didn't have a bad taste but my cupcakes turned out more like muffins. They were very dense."
"0","5","Easiest recipe in the world."
"0","3","I added more milk like most people said and it was kind of moist but the next day they were extremely dry."
"0","1","Please don't go by my rating unless you do exactly as I have done. I used 3/4c Splenda, 2 egg whites and skim milk, trying to make a slightly less evil cupcake recipe. It was dense and tasted like . I made two seperate batches back to back with no luck."
"0","4","I made cupcakes from this recipe (it was the perfect amount for 12). I used soy milk instead of regular milk, used 3/4 cup raw sugar plus 1/4 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar, and used organic white flour with germ instead of all purpose flour. Also, I added green food coloring to a portion of the batter and marbled it for festive St. Patrick's Day cupcakes. They taste great. I can understand why some people might note a 'cornbread' taste, but I don't find it offensive and it is nothing that a little frosting won't cure! Thanks for this easy alternative to the box cake."
"0","5","So good! Very moist. I doubled this recipe to make a lemon blueberry cake. I left the butter as 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of canola oil. I used 1 cup sugar, 1 cup Splenda, so I also added nonfat dry milk powder (1/2 c. milk powder and 1/2 tsp. baking soda per cup of Splenda) to make up for any lack of volume from the missing sugar. I added an extra cup of milk and lotsa lemon and vanilla extracts, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Frosted it with lemon cream cheese frosting. Super flavorful and delicious cake. Making this again soon!"
"0","4","this was a really great cake. i made cupcakes for my brothers school cake walk. i just ate three... they do have a bit of a cronbready taste on the outside, but the inside is just delicious."
"0","4","this was good. i made cupcakes with it and they were moist."
"0","3","This cake was very dry and flavorless. Next time I would add oil and less margarine and maybe a little more vanilla. I could have just been having an 'off' baking day. Will try again and make a few changes."
"0","5","I used this recipe to make cupcakes for a 'snow day' from school last week. I had some canned icing in the pantry and no cake mix, so I tried this. My kids loved them. I thought they actually tasted better the next day. At any rate, they are all gone now...gobbled them all right up. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
"0","3","This was just ok. I added a little extra milk. In the end, though, it was very heavy and not at all fluffy. It's good if you don't feel like going to the store for cake mix though."
"0","3","The cake tastes alright and it is easy to make, but I found it very dry and heavy."
"0","3","this was an ok recipe. Too much work for the same result as a box."
"0","4","Very very tasty. Flavor is excellent, my only complaint is it was pretty dense for my use. I made 1.5 recipes and used them for 3-9' round cakes for a layer cake. After refrigeration the layers were a bit dense and a little crumbly. I would definitely make again, just change it around a bit. I bet this would make some mean cupcakes."
"0","5","I made a gluten free version of this and it was out of this world!!! First GF white cake I have converted and it was a hit with the whole house. I did add the extra milk and doubled the whole recipe to get some cup cakes out of it. It doubled very nicely. Made a great b-day cake for my husband. Thanks."
"0","4","=) That was pretty good...really simple to make, I made it with my lil sis and she really enjoyed it. I put a little more vanilla like other's suggested but I regret it now, it was to strong. Thanx for the recipe."
"0","2","Even when using this cake for the Tiramisu Layer Cake and pouring 1/4 cup of coffee and 1 Tbsp coffee flavored liqueur over the cake it was STILL dry. And that was after following the review advice AND adding 1/2 cup of applesauce to the batter. I'm afraid the only positive thing I have to say is that it's edible. Sorry!"
"0","2","As said in the previous review's, the end effect is a corn bread type. It was fluffy and moist, but had a really sweet corn bread taste to it. I would not choose this over a box mix."
"0","5","I tried this recipe adding extra milk and slightly less sugar. Instead of vanilla, I added lemon and orange zest.   This is a flexible recipe that allows you to experiment and works a treat!"
"0","5","This was absolutely great. My roommate is a huge peppermint fan, so i crumbled candy canes and added it in for a potluck, well there was none left and everyone asked for the recipe. Definetly a keeper!"
"0","3","This was fine, but not as good as what comes out of a box mix from the store! I was hoping to duplicate a mix using ingredients I had on hand, and this was good (we ate it all!) but not as fluffy and moist as a box mix. I'll keep looking for the perfect cupcake recipe and keep buying the mixes until I find it."
"0","4","The texture was good, not too dense. I added the extra egg white and 1/4 cup more milk as suggested by others. I've made this cake twice now in cupcake form. The first time it was a little bland so I double the vanilla the second time around. Also, to make it a bit lighter I took another person's suggestion and beat the egg white before adding it to the batter and I think it helped. I added mini chocolate chips the second time and I find they tasted really good. I'll keep this recipe till I find something better. The first time this cake was about a three, but with the modifications it's a four."
"0","3","I added some almond extract. It made the taste wonderful. However, it was more of a light yellow cake than a white cake. Other white cake recipes I've used have had whipped heavy cream folded into it, or no egg yolks to make it whiter. It was also quite dense, not light and fluffy at all."
"0","5","These were easy and great! I used 1/4 cup of vanilla creamer and 1/4 of milk, and they came out perfectly moist."
"0","5","This is the best white cake!! I am making it again with a twist substituting 1/2 tspn vanilla with peppermint extract. and adding 2 tbls of cocoa. with ande's pieces.. for a special treat."
"0","4","No Surprises with this one! Very tasty, doubled the recipe and made 24 cupcakes for school. Delicious!"
"0","4","Cake was very tasty but a little drier than I like cake to be. But it's a nice simple recipe and I will make it again."
"0","4","I made it on my mum's birthday and every body liked it!"
"0","4","This recipe was really easy to make, I actually made it with the extra milk like one of the reviews suggested. I was crunched for time and used the buttercream recipe off the back of the powdered sugar box which made this cake taste like giant sugar cookie. Way too sweet. So I suggest a much lighter frosting to accompany this recipe."
"0","4","good, but not great. Has the texture of a muffin, but sweeter. Crispy tops and bottoms. I probably would make again."
"0","4","I'll def. make this again. Came out more like pound cake than birthday cake. I'll sift the flour next time and I might try it with cocoa as others have suggested. Super easy recipe and it was gone very quickly. I made this with a cream cheese icing and put whole strawberries on top. It was a huge hit."
"0","4","This cake was good because it stayed together when I took it out of the pan and it was easy to cut into a shape and ice. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was a little dry, I think I will try adding more milk next time.  I also noticed the recipe didn't make alot. I doubled the recipe and I was still only able to bake one cake."
"0","5","It was very good but somehow mine turned out very flat."
"0","4","Very good, and super easy! Doesn't take much time! It was a hit at home!"
"0","2","We followed the directions perfectly and baked the cake for just 30 minutes,it was burnt so bad it couldnt be used for the birthday.I was most disappointed,but will try again at a lower temp."
"0","5","This was very simple and absolutely delicious! I am not much of a baker but I was very happy with how my cupcakes turned out and the kids loved them too!"
"0","3","Too dense and hard, good flavor though."
"0","5","This cake was just what I was looking for! It tastes just like a cake version of sugar cookies. Can't beat that! I baked in my spring-form 9 inch round pan and it looks gorgeous. Served with strawberries and whipping cream as a sweet version of strawberry shortcake. As other reviews suggested, I added a whole T vanilla and about 1/8 c extra milk. It's sooo easy and delicious. Thanks!"
"0","5","Really easy wonderful cake. Added 1/2 cup cocoa and a bit more milk. Really good, my kids love it. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","I loved this cake. I used 1 cup of milk suggested by the previous reviews and I also used 2 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tsp coconut extract because my boyfriend just loves coconut flavour. The cake came out very moist and flavourful. The extract you use determine the flavour of this cake which is great because you cake make it any flavour you want. I will double the recipe and make this for my mom."
"0","5","It was very easy for a beginner like me. I made cupcakes, but added a tiny bit more vanilla and 1/8 cup more milk as suggested by some other posters and they turned out great."
"0","5","These were GREAT! So quick and easy to make! Very moist with a great taste! I also took to advice from other reviews and added 1 cup of milk, it was perfect! Will definately keep this recipe! THANK YOU! =)"
"0","5","This recipe is SOOO delicous! Me and my little brother were just making it and had so much fun, especially playing around and eating the batter! I recommend this recipe for occasions such as bonding time with children or parents, birthdays, anniversarys, Valentines day, and just for fun! ? Always..."
"0","4","i've been trying out this recipe over and over again and finally i've succeeded. it is really moist and tasty. definitely gonna do it again. maybe once a week!"
"0","5","very moist and flavor."
"0","5","this cake turned out great!! it was a bit heavier than i expected, but i didn't make any changes to the recipe. it was very easy to make!"
"0","5","Taking many bits of advice from other reviews on altering ingreds I made this into mini cupcakes and altered the recipe to use 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp almond extract, increased the milk to 1 cup and they were great! The almond extract really added to the flavor! They do not rise as much as traditional cake mixes, but this made a very easy to frost flat top! I had some plain and others I iced with Banana Butter Icing recipe also found on this site. My 4 yr old loved these and loved helping me make them!! I will try splitting and adding either cocoa or cinnamon to the next batch for swirled variety!"
"0","5","I am in love with this recipe, and have made it twice in the past week. I've used a 10-inch springform pan, and gotten a plump, moist layer with a nice crumb each time. It is especially nice with a buttercream icing and toasted coconut."
"0","3","Although this was a pretty simple recipe as stated in the name, it was not the white cake recipe I was looking for. I think this was more of a muffin recipe. So I only gave it 3 stars. I did have to change the amount of milk and vanilla as others had. As I was making cupcakes to take to my daughters school, I needed to double the recipe and ended up using aboout 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cup milk. I did not have the problem with them turning out like cornbread at all. More then likely the result of over-baking as one reviewer mentioned. I had left one batch in longer and it was not a light as the other batches. Over all- I think this would make a great muffin mix. Just add fresh blueberries to the batter. If you are looking for a great cake or cupcake recipe...this is not it."
"0","5","I love this cake. It's soft, fluffy, and really delicious."
"0","5","Very good recipe! I made cupcakes and my boys loved them!"
"0","4","I changed the recipe to yield 20 servings..:) added cinnamon and raisins and it turned out delicious! Thanks for sharing!!"
"0","5","This is really good! I used 1 C. milk and 4 tsp. vanilla and it turned out great! Soft and fluffy!! I also divided the batter and added cocoa to have marble cupcakes! Really good! Thanks!!!"
"0","5","My husband and I were craving something sweet and had minimal ingredients. This cake was very quick, easy and delicious. Kudos!"
"0","4","Good recipe but was not as white as I thought it would be. I would use just egg whites next time. Overall taste was excellent! Would definitely use again."
"0","4","Yum."
"0","5","I loved this cake! I substituted smart balance margarine for the butter and 'fake eggs' for the eggs and beat it til creamy. I loved the texture which was heavier and the taste was great! Will try splenda next time for the sugar."
"0","5","This recipe is excellent. Cooks till the end. I made a cake with this recipe. I put less sugar, put some cherries (cut them in half, from store cherrie cartens). Also i put some vegetable oil, and except for butter i put margerine (olive oil). It ended up very good."
"0","2","Kinda dry."
"0","4","Perfect, very easy recipe. It made a very tasteful birthday for my friend with a little chocolate frosting on top."
"0","4","This is a simple and delicious recipe!! I only made 6 cupcakes and they turned out so yummy!"
"0","4","Very Yummy! I frosted them with a traditional buttercream frosting but used orange extract in place of vanilla. However, these would be just as good plain."
"0","5","this cake is so easy to make and tastes a million times better than any boxed mix. it's not very white, but it's a good cake none the less. it's quite filling. also it is not too sweet, which is perfect!"
"0","5","I used this recipe to make cupcakes with the little girl I babysit - they were terrific! They were nice and moist, and I liked that they were just a touch 'cookie-like' on top - makes them perfect on their own! Thanks for this recipe!"
"0","5","Soooo simple. My three year old son and I made these (cup cakes) after dinner. They're really simple and there's so many differant ways to decorate them!"
"0","5","I loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was skip using any milk, and instead of using 2 tsp. vanilla extract I used 1/4 tsp. vanilla and 1-3/4 tsp. freshly squeezed lime juice. The result was really delicious and muffin-y (brown and well cooked outside, soft inside! yum!) Next time I'll add some chocolate chips to the batter to make it a chocolate chip muffin. I'll use this recipe again."
"0","5","This is by far the best recipe I have ever found for simple white cake!!! I made the cupcakes...and I was lucky to get to try one, they were gone so fast!! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe."
"0","5","This recipe is absolutely amazing!!! It was nice and moist and nice by itself or with frosting. I've made this several times and i will continue using this!"
"0","2","Ok - so I'm not sure if I did anything wrong. But I'm a fantastic baker...and typically when trying out new recipes I don't alter it...though for this recipe I added a bit of salt. Everything else I followed to a 'T'...and the cupcakes came out...kind of greasy (it may have been the european butter i was using)..and my boyfriend thought they had the consistency of cornbread muffins. They weren't super fluffy and soft as I was hoping they'd be. I may try this recipe again because it got so many good reviews."
"0","5","i made these as cupcakes for my daughters birthday party, and they were great. made 3 batches, one with the vanilla essence, one batch with lemon and one with coconut they were great."
"0","2","I am not sure but it seemed to me like the batter was way too thick to be a cake batter I had to add at least another 3/4 to 1 cup more of milk to thin it out....not what i expected at all,"
"0","1","These were not good at all, they turned out more like biscuits rather than cupcakes. I used a lot of icing to try to make up for the dry, bland taste of the cupcakes, but it didn't really work. The icing was good though. (My own recipe) Sorry."
"0","3","I don't think that I did it Correctly because it turned out to be more like crum cake than solid cake but the flavor if you add Peppermint instead of Vanilla is very GOOD"
"0","4","i made this recipe for my friend's Bday. thiscake was perfect because it was easy and fast to make and my friends loved the cupcakes. i used Nutela for frosting and topped them with fresh raspberries. they tasted wonderful, Thank you for your recipe"
"0","4","Very tasty cake, but I wish the recipe was large enough for a regular size cake."
"0","5","this was really good...especially with icing! i added an extra 2 tablespoons of milk and it came out great and i added a little more sugar too...it came out great!my fam loved them thanks for the recipe!will make this again!"
"0","5","This cake is simple to make, and DELICIOUS!! Tender, not too sweet, perfect if you want your filling to be the main event. Delicious with a simple frosting as well."
