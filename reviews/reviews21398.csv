"2348","5","This is the same recipe that my mother has made for years, and it is often said that it was this pudding that helped her snag her husband. I have noticed a few problems people have been having with the recipe, and as usual it is not problems really with the recipe, but with the person/and or technique used while making it. (Don't mean to sound harsh.) First off, we always use skim milk in the recipe, and have never had a any problems. Secondly, NEVER use banana pudding to make this. Though I'm sure it would taste ok, it just isn't like the old fashioned stuff, and if you use the banana flavored pudding you always will have that fake banana flavoring floating around in it...YUCK. Third, one 5 oz. package is plenty to make this pudding thick. Just make sure to use ice cold milk when mixing it. Fourth, when creaming the cream cheese. It must be at room temperature before you can cream it or add the other ingredients to it, otherwise, you will get a lumpy mess. It is very important to cream it well with the sweetened condensed milk, because the air incorperated into this adds body and thickness to the overall dish. Finally, the dish that the recipe says to display the pudding in is merely a suggestion. This isn't a baked recipe, so it won't matter at all what type of dish you use. I prefer a large decorative glass bowl, and that way it can add a little more style to the whole dinner just by looking at it, and after that first bite, none of your guests/family/friends will"
"1026","5","Instead of the one larger box of instant vanilla pudding, I used one small box of instant vanilla pudding and one small box of instant banana cream pudding. I also replaced half the milk with heavy cream and used a tub of the extra creamy Cool Whip instead of the regular Cool Whip. Also, instead of the whole can of sweetened condensed milk, I used less than half because I didn't want it to be too sweet. I also crumbled some Nilla wafers on the top for a better presentation. I also used a smaller pan (I used a deeper, square casserole dish) and layered it in two layers instead of just one. I also put the sliced bananas in some diluted lemon juice to prevent browning. It is absolutely delicious and looks very appetizing!"
"857","5","I just have one comment. People who give reviews and have changed the recipe are not helpful at all. For once, I would like to see reviews based on exactly how the recipe is written."
"717","5","I took this to a party, and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes - I used Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies in place of the Nilla wafers. I used only 2 cups milk to mix into the instant pudding. I beat the pudding & milk with a mixer, then beat the cream cheese with the condensed milk separately, stirred the cool whip into the cheese mixture, and added that to the instant pudding. I used 8 bananas to make the 13 x 9 panful. The pudding set up perfectly and cut like a dream - no running or soupiness. The bananas did darken after we cut into it, but they tasted just as good the second day. This will serve a TON of people. This is my new favorite pudding recipe!"
"281","5","I have been making this recipe for over two years for family and large parties and have NEVER had any leftovers. People get upset if I don't bring this with me! I use 1-3.4oz. pkg of French Vanilla Instant pudding mix, and 1/2 of a 3.4oz. pkg of Banana Instant pudding mix, only 1/2 of the can of condensed milk to keep it from being overly sweet. I do also use more bananas, about six cover the bottom of a 9X13 pan. Everything else is the same. Yes, the cream cheese definately needs to be room temperature. EVERYONE who has tried this has loved it, asked for the recipe, and always wants me to bring it to their get-together. It is not like the original on-the-stove banana pudding which is very rich, this is a much lighter version and for the thousands that I have fed, much more preferred."
"253","5","YUM! I too followed the advise to use 3.5 oz size banana cream and a 3.5 oz size vanilla pudding instead of the 5 oz vanilla box. I reduced the condensed milk to 1/2 a can and it was still rich but delicious!! :)~  I put mine in a round bowl (IE small punch bowl, decorative bowl) and ended up with two layers. I used a whole 12 oz box of vanilla wafers. I sprinkled lemon juice on the bananas to keep them from browning. Next time I would suggest trying Fruit Fresh or something of the like.  MY suggestion is this....if you aren't making this for a large family/gathering and don't think you will have gobbled it up in about two days, then don't add the sliced bananas to the dessert.  Try slicing a banana and serving it on top or bottom of the bowl as you serve it. This will keep the bananas from turning brown and the dessert will last longer in your refrigerator.  Good Dessert!"
"209","5","This was fabulous! I read through ALL the reviews, made a couple of recommended changes, and now have the best recipe for banana pudding that we've ever had. I used l 3.4-oz box of instand banana pudding and 1 3.4-oz box of French vanilla pudding. I cut the milk from 3 cups to 2 cups. Otherwise, it was the same as the recipe. Also, I topped it with crushed Nilla Wafers right before I served it. There were 10 of us at dinner, and it was gobbled up very quickly. Everyone LOVED it and wanted the recipe!"
"121","5","My mom and gramma were from the south and this no cook banana pudding is a staple. My granny made her's more like a pie and didn't use the condensed milk. Either way it's SO good and tastes heavenly! And seriously, for those of you who change the recipe by using fat free this or that, and reduced calorie and then leave less than 5 stars because it didnt come out right or tastes funny?! WTH people! You should be banned from allrecipes!"
"116","1","My cream cheese was at room temperature. I followed the recipe. The only thing I did differently was put in half the condensed milk (which a lot of people suggested in order to make it less sweet)... and it turned into a soup that never thickened. What did I do wrong?"
"97","5","Love this recipe. I have used it a total of 5 times. I used Jello pudding mix.  1st time turned out perfect 2nd time turned out perfect 3rd time - the pudding was runny and just wouldn't set. 4th time - the pudding was runny and just wouldn't set. 5th time - I figured out my mistake and it turned out perfect.  On my 3rd and 4th tries, it turns out I got the Jello 'Cook & Serve' mix instead of the 'Instant' mix . It was entirely my mistake, but it was such an easy mistake to make! Both boxes look exactly the same - same colors same font, except on the left bottom of the front of the box where one says 'Instant' and the other says 'Cook & Serve'.  Make sure to get the 'Instant' pudding mix."
"89","4","Six of us had this for dessert last nite and all thought it was yummy. I used a bit more than half of the sweetened condensed milk (as per other reviewers), added an extra banana, and made it in a clear, deep bowl. That way I was able to make layers and also lay the 'Nilla wafers up against the side of the bowl for 'looks'. Tonite we ate the 'leftovers' and thought they were even better. I sliced up some fresh banana in each person's bowl before serving the leftover pudding."
"85","5","i made this recipe for my bookclub and everyone wanted the recipe...i took the advice of one reviewer and cut the milk to 2 cups and i used the pepperidge farms butter pecan chessman cookies...was EXCELLENT...thanks patricia..."
"59","5","I am really posting this review on behalf of my family. They LOVE this recipe. I've been making it for years now and am only now writing a review. I had a get-together last week and my sister actually got irritated with me because I hadn't made 'My Banana Pudding.' I keep telling them that I got the recipe here, and they keep attributing it to me! Oh well, I'll take the compliment! Change NOTHING, but do make the sure the cream cheese is room temperature. It's divine, and this is coming from a family born and bred in Savannah. We know good banana pudding! The ONLY advice I would give is being careful when you use a hand mixer - It can get a little 'splashy'. I use a tupperware top to block the spritzes. Of course, I usually don't make desserts, so I could very well just be inept. Regardless, you will LOVE this recipe, and fans of banana pudding will rave and quite possibly buy you gifts. When I make this I have to double the recipe so my husband can eat the other half! He actualy (jokingly) encourages party guests not to eat it so that he can pig out later. It's a little alarming, how much of this one grown man can eat, but that's my problem, not yours! Make this!!!!!"
"57","5","I used Lite Cool Whip, lite cream cheese and reduced calorie vanilla wafers. To keep that 'rich' taste, though, I used whole milk (rather than 2% or fat-free) and regular condensed milk (rather than lowfat). No one seemed to notice and everyone raved about the taste.   Plus, I use a couple more bananas and the whole box of wafers when I make it. Makes a GIANT bowlful! Thanks Patricia for posting this recipe!"
"54","5","This was very good. I always made the warm banana pudding but my family liked this one a lot. So now I ahve a great warm one and a cold one. Thanks!"
"32","5","OMG this was AAAAAmazing! I had alot of people over this weekened and everyone LOVED this dish. I felt proud of what I accomplished in presenting something that everyone loved. Only thing is, I really didn't make it. I have to give credit to my 9 year old who basically made the whole thing by himself. There was one little change that we made and that was putting the enitre container of whipped cream in the pudding mixture. That was done, well... because the 9 year old did it. It turned out fantastic. Everyone said how light and fluffy it was. Total Hit! And... 'So easy even a 9 year old can do it!'"
"27","5","Oh My God! I use Allrecipe recipes probably 2 - 3 nights a week - some are great, some are good, some are real losers. However, this banana pudding recipe is the top - it is AWESOME! The second it hits your mouth you are in heaven - I am not exaggerating - I will make this everytime I am asked to bring a dessert anywhere - fabulous. Try it - you will NOT be disappointed! Thank you Patricia!"
"21","5","I have been making this for years and it never fails to get rave reviews. I have tried it with all low fat/low sugar ingredients and you can't taste the difference. Now that DH and I are empty nesters, I make a half recipe and it too turns out wonderful. Couple of tricks I've learned to ramp it up a notch are - 1) I slice the bananas and then squeeze some fresh lemon juice over them and toss. This not only helps keep them from turning brown but serves to cut the sweetness slightly and 2) I don't like the artificial banana flavor in the instant banana pudding so to bump up the banana flavor I take one (or two) bananas, slightly mash them and then nuke them on high for 20 sec stirring after 10sec. I then stir in a squeeze of lemon and mash them really well and add to the mixture before stirring in the whipped cream. The microwave really softens the banana and causes it to release it's juice really adding to the flavor. Try it next time and see what you think..."
"21","5","Very good! I did like many other reviewers and used a glass bowl and layered the ingredients...2 layers of cookies, bananas, pudding and topped with whipped topping and cookie crumbs. I used low fat everything...milk, condensed milk, cream cheese, and it still tasted great! I DO regret that I didn't use the whole can of milk. I followed others' advice and only used 1/2 can, and I would have preferred it to be a tad bit sweeter. It still has a delicious taste, but it would have been better with the whole can. EASY, DELICIOUS recipe! Good luck! Ally"
"18","5","Made this yesterday for a picnic, yes in Upstate NY it was 65 and sunny and we had a picnic!   Anyways, I read the reviews and just had to make this.  The one review asked if it was supposed to be soupy. That stuck in my head for what ever reason.  I was putting this together and got to the point to add milk. I stopped in mid action to check the recipe again, 3 cups. I used a package of pudding mix that only used 2 cups, NOW i know why that others was soupy. Checked the size and I used the small package and not the larger one.  So only adding 2 cups of milk, I then added the whole container of whipped topping.  All was perfect!  I used fat free CC, fat free cond. milk, low fat cookies and skim milk. It was fantastic! All 14 people that had it loved it, raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I will make this again. Totally a wonderful easy and tasty dessert! Thanks!"
"17","5","Very good and perfect balance of flavors. I enjoy bringing this to potlocks because it's portable and disappears quickly. I've learned to carry copies of the recipe with me when I go so I can hand out copies to all who ask for it. Thank you!"
"16","5","Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! My dad's favorite dessert - out of 50 years he said it was the best he ever had. Everyone agreed. Thanks!"
"15","5","Look no further for a quick, easy and delicious banana pudding recipe. As others have mentioned, it is much better when it sits 8 hrs. or overnight. Dive into it any sooner and you may notice an aftertaste from the sweetened condensed milk. I ususally use Chessmen or sometimes coconut cookies instead of vanilla wafers due to the family's preference. The Cool Whip 'extra creamy' really works well in this."
"14","5","Loved it!!"
"14","5","One day I was having a craving for the banana pudding and vanilla wafer dessert even though I did not have a recipe. I went on this website and sure enough found an excellent version. This has to be one of the best banana pudding recipes out there. I will definately make it again. This would also be great for a pot luck dish."
"12","5","Soooo yummy! This dessert does not last long when i make it. I alwyas put it in a trifle dish for easy assemble and beautiful presentation. I make just as directed, however i add a little more cream cheese to cut back on the sweetness and it almost tastes like a cheesecake factory banana cheesecake. I always make my own whipping cream to make it more rich and less artificial tasting. I would not use banana flavored pudding in this like some reviewers did...that would make it taste too artificial tasting."
"11","3","Make sure u use instant pudding mix. If you use 'cook and serve' one the pudding will turn out soupy."
"11","5","This is the BEST banana pudding recipe ever. It tastes exactly like that good old Southern pudding. I dont like whipped topping so I used real whipped cream instead, 1 cup yields 2 cups whipped. I used this pudding in a angel food cake. I sliced the top off the cake,carved out the middle of cake, used the removed cake in the pudding, spooned the pudding in the 'trough' and put the top of the cake back on.Frosted the whole cake with left over whipped cream and topped with strawberries.I got huge raves from everyone that tried it. My family has been hounding me to make 'more, more and more!'."
"9","5","I am a huge fan of banana pudding and an even bigger fan of this recipe. I doubled this recipe for Easter and the only change I made was decreasing the condensed milk to half of what it called for. It was a bit hit and the entire dish was gone! This was easy to make and calls for few ingredients. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!"
"9","5","Delicious but I found 1/2 (7oz) can sweetened condensed milk is sufficiently sweet for my taste buds."
"9","4","this is a good receipe, i have a comment for the peanut gallery. do not use banana instant pudding. your pudding will taste like store bought pudding.. dont soak your banasnas in lemmon juice ,bananas arnt ready to be used in pudding UNTILL they start to turn brown,that is where the flavor comes from. if you don't believe me , ask your grandmother. if your worried that your pudding will go bad or stay in the frig to long, dont if you made it rite, it will disapear. and they will ask for the receipe FRODO"
"9","5","this is practically identical to Paula Dean's 'not your mama's banana pudding'. But she adds an even better touch: she uses Pepperidge Farms chess cookies in place of vanilla wafers-whenever we make this, it is met with raves! [we also make homemade pudding and whipped cream-it adds wonderful flavor]"
"9","5","This is a fantastic recipe! I've been making this banana pudding for holiday meals for the last 3 years, and my family looks forward to it every time. Earlier writers are correct that the cream cheese should be room temperature, and must also be completely blended into the pudding mixture -- however long it takes -- otherwise you'll be chewing on creamy cheesy lumps."
"9","5","This pudding is DIVINE! I followed the instructions/ingredients on the foodtv.com recipe ('Not Yo' Mama's Banana Pudding'), which uses more bananas and Pepperidge Farms Chessman cookies. YOU MUST REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK!!!! I used 3/4 as much, and I think I'll reduce it more next time. I cut the recipe in half to fill an 8 x 8 pan, but I used 3.4 oz French vanilla pudding and 3 oz cream cheese for convenience's sake. I added an extra layer of bananas between the top of the pudding and the top layer of cookies, and I think I'll add a layer in the middle next time. My dad loves banana pudding, and he can't stop eating this!! I want to use the pudding recipe itself (no nanas/cookies) to make a 'dessert pizza,' using ready-made chocolate chip or sugar cookie dough as a crust and fresh fruit as toppings."
"9","5","I make this for all my gatherings with my friends. Awesome! After making this over & over again I found that using a little over half the can of condensed milk makes it perfect on the sweetness scale! Comes out perfect! Thanks Patricia you have mad this a favorite!"
"8","5","Love this recipe! A couple of tips should be mentioned and one is to let the cream cheese soften at room temperature before beating. It creams much easier. Also, let the cool whip come to room temperature as well. What a great treat! My son loves it."
"8","5","As you can see, this recipe is rated 5 stars even after a thousand ratings. It IS delicious, in absolute entirety. This made a perfectly textured pudding, with the varying textures of the banana slices and the vanilla wafer cookies. I have made this recipe a hundred times now and served it as a simple dessert. Since it is so decadently flavored with the pudding, the milk and the rich creme cheese, it is always assumed as a 'professional' dish, even though anyone with some experience can make it. Plus it makes so much, and is so easy to prepare beautifully! I'd recommend this to anyone who loves pudding - and bananas - as much as I do."
"8","5","Excellent recipe! As others suggested, I added an extra 3.4oz box of vanilla pudding. I had six soft bananas so I beat them and folded them into the pudding mixture - tastes great. I forgot to thaw my cool whip so in the morning I will just layer itin a pan with the whip topping."
"8","5","Hands down, the best banana pudding recipe I have tried! The flavor was beautiful, not to mention the presentation! I followed the recipe amounts exactly & wouldn't change a thing! I loved the rich, sweet banana & vanilla flavors. The pudding set wonderfully - it 'cut' nicely & kept it's form when served, which to me makes this a top notch recipe! :) The vanilla wafers were not mushy - still had some crispiness to them even after 4 hours in the fridge. Topped w/ crushed wafer crumbs & individual wafers so each serving had one on top. Very pretty! Halving this recipe was perfect for an 8x8 square dish (9 beautiful & decadent perfect servings). This is now my go-to banana pudding. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! :)"
"8","5","Wow...delizioso!!! I did make some changes due to counting calories and such. I used fat free milk 2 cups and not 3. I also mixed the pudding in one bowl and the cream cheese (low fat) vanilla and fat free condensed milk in another. When both bowls of ingredients were well mixed I then poured in the pudding mix and folded in half the cool whip. make sure you use room temp cream cheese..or it will be all lumpy. I followed the directions exactly as stated. I lined the bottom of the dish I chose to use, not necessary to use a 9x13. Get creative and colorful! You can use any dish. Then I used the remainder of the cool whip and crushed some vanilla wafers and lady fingers...YES..lady fingers on top for eye candy! Set in fridge for 3 hrs..and it was delicious...my neighbors were in heaven asking for the recipe. It was so sweet, I am glad I used all those fat free's ingredients. I could not imagine eating any other way. Would be way to sweet and hard on the stomach. Please do not skimp on cheap imitation vanilla. Good eats to all. Will certainly make it again."
"8","5","Great recipe! Banana pudding was my favorite dessert as a child growing up. Mom would cook her custard made from milk, egg yolks, flour, sugar, and vanilla extract. The meringue, made of whipped egg whites, a little cream of tartar and sugar would be spread on top before the pudding was baked in the oven.   This recipe is simpler, in my opinion. I was able to cut down on some of the calories by using lite cool whip topping, light cream cheese, and skim milk. I used more bananas than the recipe called for. This was simple to make, as I followed one reviewer's advice and used a blender to mix the cream cheese and condensed milk, which was at room temperature, first. I then added the milk, vanilla, and instant vanilla pudding. Next, I transferred the mixture to a bowl and folded in the cool whip topping. I find it helps to allow the pudding to sit a little before assembling the layers, so that it has a chance to set up without being too runny. After completely assembling the layers, I sprinkled five or six crushed vanilla waffers over the top before chilling it in the fridge."
"8","5","I lightened the calories on this one by substituting non-fat cool whip, low-fat sweetened condensed milk, low-fat cream cheese & low-fat nilla wafers.  I loved the addition of cream cheese to this classic dessert! This will be a standard potluck fare for me from now on!"
"7","5","I have made this recipe 3 times and followed the directions exactly as far as ingredients go...only difference was I made mine in layers and topped it with crumbled nilla wafers. My husband says this is the best banana pudding he's ever eaten and he's not even a sweet eater. So I say that to say even with the entire can of condensed milk it's not too sweet. I have read other reviews and may consider some of their suggestions but this recipe is darn near perfect as is!!!"
"7","5","I made it EXACTLY according to the recipe for a Christmas dinner, changed nothing. Quick-took only about 15 minutes to make & then stuck in the fridge for 2 hours before eating. My husband & I both think it's the BEST banana pudding we've EVER eaten! Some people earlier had suggested cutting condensed milk in half; I DID NOT & it tastes GREAT! Not too sweet for me. Some earlier said they got french vanilla or banana pudding, but I stuck w/ the regular vanilla pudding n the recipe & still tastes like banana pudding since the bananas are in the bottom of the pan. Have saved this recipe & will use for family get togethers."
"7","5","I got a taste of this pudding at the Amish market and it was so good to where I would only go to get their pudding, (super-dramatic pause) for $10, large about 24 oz. Now I'm saving money and making people smile & fat. I took the advice of others and used 2 boxes of banana creme, next time I'll use vanilla in place of banana, 2 cups of vanilla almond milk and reduced fat cream cheese and (the kicker) Golden Oreo cookies. You all MUST try it because the cream just does something that intensifies the pudding to where my tastebuds were having orgasms. Hope you all enjoy the twist."
"7","5","THIS PUDDING WAS AMAZING!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. This was my first attempt at making banana pudding from scratch and I received rave reviews! My husband took some to work and the guys at his job asked if I could make it for them at least once a month, and they aren't big on desserts! I have always loved banana pudding and always wanted to learn how to cook from scratch and this was the perfect way to start. The only thing I changed was omitting the vanilla extract and adding an extra banana because I looooove banana flavor and didn't want to use banana pudding. It turned out great. I made it Wednesday night for Thanksgiving and the wafers and bananas stayed nice and firm until it was all gone Sunday! I tossed the bananas in a tablespoon of lemon juice before assembling and it kept the browning at bay. I also made 2.5 layers (the .5 was the extra banana and Nilla wafers on top) but topped it with a very thin layer of whipped topping, using a little over half in the pudding mixture. It came out firm enough to use a spatula to cut and scoop but wasn't runny. I can't wait to make this again! Definately a keeper in my recipe box!"
"7","5","AWESOME! I found mini nilla wafers....super cute! I used 6 bananas and French vanilla/ vanilla pudding mix. Sooooo good!"
"7","5","Sooooo Easy and Sooooo Good! This will feed a crowd. The 2nd time I made it, I 1/2'd the recipe. It was the perfect amount for a nice serving bowl for my family. I used the mini vanilla wafers and layered the ingreds., so every spoonfull included the pudding, cookies and bananas. EXCELLENT. Anyone can make this dessert."
"7","5","I love this recipe! The original copy that I received was titled 'Not Yo Mama's Banana Pudding'! I basically use the same ingredients, but I do use French vanilla pudding, and I use Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies instead of vanilla wafers. The presentation using the Chessman's is really cool looking in the 13x9 pan, and it gives you lines to cut & serve! I line the bottom with the cookies, add the banana's, then the mixture, and top with another bag of cookies. It is a little more expensive to use those cookies, but it's so darn cute! By far the best banana pudding I've ever tried!"
"7","5","This recipe is awesome! I was strong armed into making it for an employee commitee function and it was a huge hit. I like it with (2) packs of the 3.5oz pudding (4 cups of milk)-- it cuts a little of the sweetness (Not too much!)"
"7","5","Wow! This was delicious! I took this to the Radiology Department today and it was a hit with everyone! I went back to the break room and found my pan that had been washed and someone had put a note in it that said: 'Thank You!'. This is fabulous for potlucks and such. I brought the cream cheese to room temp, used 2 small (3.9) packages of pudding (out of the large one), 16 oz of whipped topping and sprinkled crushed vanilla wafers on top. I also tossed the sliced bananas in lemon juice to prevent browning and that worked like a charm. I passed out at least 6 requested copies of this recipe! If I was making this for my family of 4 I would cut the recipe in half and layer it in a trifle bowl. Thank you Patricia for sharing!"
"7","5","Important to note not to use skim milk for this recipe or you'll be sipping it throw a straw!! ;-)"
"7","5","This is so easy to make. Everyone enjoyed this one. It is quite refreshing on a warm summer night."
"7","1","Served this at Christmas work party. 15 different men asked for the recipe so their wives could make it. There were over a dozen different desserts there, but mine was the first and only one to be completely gone. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe. Definitely a keeper!!!"
"6","5","I made this tonight and oh my goodness! It is so delicious! I only had one small box of vanilla pudding mix, so I used that and 2 c. milk. I also used low fat sweetened condensed milk and it is still very rich. Easy to make, but tastes like you worked on it all day! I also put the banana slices in some lemon juice to keep them from browning while mixing the pudding."
"6","5","We thought this was a very good recipe. I used my food processor to cream the cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk and I creamed ½ of a medium ripe banana. Then just added the milk, vanilla pudding, etc. and blended it too. There were some saying not enough banana flavors and some saying the cream cheese was lumpy. This technique cured both problems. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. This was served at our family get together were we’ve usually used the Nabisco Wafer’s banana pudding recipe. Most all liked this recipe better, though a couple just liked the tradition of the Nabisco, but they commented that this was good – those couple of people didn’t care it was better they liked the meringue on the other – reminded them more of childhood – hard to compete with that!"
"6","5","Fabulous!....this is the best banana pudding I've tasted this far. I've made it several times and it always goes quickly. The only things I've done differently is that I use 'whipped cream cheese' instead of the blocked and I make individual size servings in 'Solo' dessert cups...and cover each cup with plastice wrap . Place in refrigerator and you can just grab a cup and eat no need to spoon out of a dish. a little time comsuming so get the kiddies to help...it is worth it....I have 15 cups in my frig right now.... yum!"
"6","5","Delicious, crowd pleasing recipe. I have made it exactly as written and have made it with less milk, and both are good--it's just a matter of preference. If you like a thicken pudding, use only two cups of milk. If you like it 'smoother' rather than 'creamier', use more milk.  I also used vanilla flavored almond milk once and loved it! No one detected it, and to me it tasted better.  Also did not find it too sweet. Lemon juice on bananas may have helped.  If it needs anything, I'd add more Nilla wafers because my kids love them.  Great recipe for sure. My husband said: 'Keep this recipe.' And I will.  Thanks for a great recipe."
"6","5","Delicious! I made exactly as written ...just used real whipped cream! Took to church lunch and it served great and I took an empty dish home! (I did put my banana slices in lemon juice before adding to prevent browning)"
"6","4","This was very good, but some alterations the second time I made it, was even better. I used french vanilla pudding(did not notice a big difference, just my preference) and only 2 cups of milk which made it less runny. I omitted the vanilla (no need for it). I, also loving bananas, felt there were not enough, so I used 8 med-lg bananas. I do love vanilla wafers, but hate when they get soggy, so I used the pepperidge farm chessman cookies, layering on the top and bottom. They do not get as soggy and since they are not as sweet as the wafers it creates a nice balance."
"6","5","This is always a huge hit and disappears quickly! I had a customer taste it and tell me she wanted to buy it... she didn't care that it wasn't half time and NO one else had tasted it!  I do also like to shave some german chocolate for added garnish"
"6","5","Fantastic! This is my new favorite recipe! Everyone has to try this banana pudding. So easy and so delicious, can't wait to make it for the kids when they get back from their vacation w/grandma!"
"6","4","I needed a quick dessert and this fit the ticket. I put the cream cheese and condensed milk into the blender and it got really smooth. I then added 1 cup milk and continued to blend. I poured it into a bowl and added the rest of the ingred. I used a little lemon pudding mix since I was low on vanilla and it was wonderful. It had a light and fluffy texture. I am giving it only 4 stars because it was too sweet for me....way too sweet, so next time I am going to use the pudding for the 'cream puff cake' in this since that is not nearly as sweet and uses cream cheese as well. I cannot wait to try that!!"
"6","5","For those that think this is way too sweet, I add an additional 3 oz package of pudding (2 more cups milk). It just makes more (I can share with others this way). I add the whole container of cool whip to the pudding - it makes it very creamy. I also use a whole package of vanilla wafers because we like more cookies. Been making this for years - it is one of our favoriets."
"6","5","Tasted great and looked really pretty."
"6","1","NOTHING SPECIAL - would not make again"
"6","5","I made this pudding for the first time after being away from my family for years and never having any all that time. I added 1/4c sugar, 1oz extra of cream cheese, used two 3.40z pkgs of vanilla pudding mix, 2 tsp of vanilla, and 2c cold milk with 1/2c heavy cream, and my LAST change was that I used the entire box of Nilla wafers for decor. The mixture was thick and creamy and the first bite reminded me of when I was ten years old in my aunt's kitchen cleaning greens lol...I enjoyed this recipe very much I just tweaked it a little for my sweet tooth."
"6","5","Delicious! After I added the milk, it was very thin, and I couldn't imagine it ever setting up, but it's the perfect texture! My husband is in heaven!"
"6","5","Made this at least 7 times, each one tastes the same and is SO delicious and super-easy. I've got it down to where I can make it 20 minutes before I go into work and just refrigerate for four hours there during the 'fridge' time. One of my 'oops', however, was I added the banana pudding mix before I put in the milk, DO NOT DO THIS. It will thicken up your mix so much it will be next to impossible to get it undone. Add about half the milk and then add the pudding mix, so even as you are adding the last of the milk it won't be so thick you can't stir it. Another secret: Leave the cream cheese out until room temperature (about 1/2 hour - 1 hour in 72 degree climate household), THEN whisk that until smooth and add the evaporated milk, wisk until smooth. Turns out perfect and smooth every time."
"6","4","I didn't understand what all of the excitement was over this recipe. It tasted like any banana pudding recipe, but was slightly improved by the cream cheese. It is also very sweet possible because of the sweetened condensed milk added. This is one of very few desserts I have ever made that did not get eaten up."
"6","3","Next time I will choose the basic version of Jello pudding mix. I won't be spending the block of cream cheese and container of sweetened condensed milk on this again. It was way to light and fluffy, didn't have a good vanilla pudding flavor (too mellowed out by the cream cheese, SCM, and Cool Whip). Very fluffy. Not worth the calories!"
"6","5","absolutely the best! everytime I make this for someone new they always request it for their birthday, office potlucks, just because. It's a winner. Do not I repeat put banana pudding mix in this recipe, it will ruin it. It's too fake. The natural bannana will give it all the flavor it needs."
"6","2","I gave this two stars because I obviously did something wrong. I think what I did wrong was not let the ingredients come to room themperature so be sure to do this or don't bother making it. I will not try this one again."
"6","4","I've made a similar recipe many times over the years, but I've never added cream cheese. It was a very tasty addition. I accidentally purchased the smaller package of pudding, but it worked out fine anyway. Initially, I cut back on the milk due to the smaller amount of pudding, but it was too thick, so I used the full amount. I also added a good dose of vanilla. I make them invidually so the mixture doesn't go south before it's eaten. Add a little extra milk, and this makes a good custard sauce for topping fruit or cake or whatever!"
"6","5","This was by far the BEST banana pudding I've ever had. I made it with all the ingredients and measurements, but lightened up on the fat, sugar and calories just a bit. I used 1/3 fewer fat cream cheese, reduced fat Nilla wafers, fat-free sugar-free pudding and lite Cool-Whip. I used whole milk because pudding doesn't always turn out very well with fat-free or lower fat milk. It's not entirely guilt-free, but not quite as bad for you as it would be with all the extra fat and calories! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe."
"6","5","I forgot to buy the whipped topping so I made it without it and it turned out just fine. My husband loved it!"
"6","5","I followed everyones advice and used 2 smaller boxes of pudding one vanilla and one banana creme. This made an excellent tasting desert! The bananas did get brown after a few days in the fridge despite using Fruit Fresh and the cookies got really soft. Next time I make this, knowing it will sit in the fridge for a few days, I will skip the bananas and cookies and just make the pudding! Yum."
"6","5","delicious"
"5","5","I have made this recipe multiple times and the reaction from my guests is always the same, everyone loves it! It is easy, cheap to make, and it serves a bunch of people. Cream cheese and cool whip must be soft (at room temperature) in order for the mixture to turn out creamy and fluffy. This pudding is a MAJOR crowd pleaser! You can't go wrong with it (unless you change all sorts of things in the recipe and end up with a mess in your hands)."
"5","5","I've been making this recipe for years (sans the vanilla...need to try that next time) and it's so easy and definitely a crowd favorite. What I like, it that it can be made with ff or low-fat ingredients with little or no affect to taste. It's important to let the cream cheese get to room temperature to help with the lumps. One idea I've had, but admit haven't tried, is to make a chocolate version of this using chocolate pudding mix and oreos or chocolate wafers. Yummers!!! Try it, I'm guessing this recipe will become a family favorite!"
"5","5","Sooooo good! I did alter it a bit. I made fresh whipped cream with heavy cream and a little powdered sugar. This makes such a difference. It eliminates the chemical taste in cool whip and artificial ingredients. I also made two layers of cookies, using a whole box and 6 bananas. Topped with more whipped cream and 6 crushed wafers."
"5","5","This is now a favorite in our home! This dessert never makes it pass a couple of hours when I make it. I always use plenty of vanilla wafers and bananas. Very good recipe."
"5","5","I made this with NO SUBSTITUTIONS - because none were needed. This tastes just like grandma used to make and everyone loved it. Take it from a Texan - this is how banana pudding is supposed to taste!!!"
"5","5","Just made this recipe and i found it so great that i just had to turn my computer back on to write my first review EVER!!! I made this with my 4 year old daughter and there was so much for her to do, she loved it and i wasn't worried that it would be ruined LOL. We had an absolute blast and are now enjoying it together! Thank you so much Patty."
"5","5","Just made this yesterday for the Superbowl. This recipe is amazing!! Only thing I changed was I used LornaDoone cookies and french vanilla pudding. I couldn't stop eating this and neither could anyone else. Thank you so much. I have a friend who thinks her banana pudding is topnotch and will never share the recipe. I no longer need it!!!"
"5","5","Fantastic. Followed to the letter but with light cream cheese and skim milk. Use very ripe bananas."
"5","5","This is always a hit!"
"5","4","I would definitely advise making this the day of. I was eating leftovers the day after and the wafers all become soggy so there was no textural contrast. My family yelled at me for not bringing the leftover vanilla wafers so if you have any leftover, bring them! I used the banana cream and vanilla pudding packages but I felt like the banana flavoring was a little too strong so I might not put all the banana in next time. All in all, it was well received."
"5","5","Ive always enjoyed eating this dish, but never made it myself. So when I looked it up, and found this recipe, I thought the ingredients were wierd, but MAN was it good!!!! I used one 5oz package of banana cream pudding, and used low fat milk for the milk. I followed the recipe as is, but used the banana cream pudding instead. I also didnt need 4 bananas, but mine were big so i only needed 3. I also crushed some extra cookies on the top and it looked pretty. I made it for a family bbq, and they loved it! I know this will be asked for lots of time, thanks!"
"5","5","I made this about 4 years ago for Easter and everyone was all raves! Since then, it has become a given that this will be made by me at every family get together. My neices, nephews and children would have a fit it it did not make an appearance. The only change that I made was to use the banana cream instant pudding in the place of the vanilla pudding. A fabulous recipe, when you try this - you will never make 'homemade' again."
"5","5","Excellent banana pudding, with the creme cheese adding the right texture and body. I made it exactly as described, but will change the store-bought whipped topping with real whipped cream the next time I make this. I can definitely taste the odd oily/greasy flavor of imitation whipped topping, and whipped cream is really easy to make yourself. I also refuse to ever attempt this recipe with banana flavored pudding mix as so many others here have suggested. Use the 5 oz vanilla pudding mix as described. Banana flavored pudding mix has a very strong non-banana fake flavor that will cheapen the entire recipe. If you let this sit over night like it is supposed to, it will have tons of banana flavor without the fake pudding."
"5","4","Took to a church gathering and everyone loved it! Rated 4 stars due to one change: I easily made my own whipping cream, using 8 ozs heavy whipping cream; (mix with a hand mixer on high for 1 min until peaks form, then add 2 tbsp sugar, beat again until stiff peaks form, about 1 more minute). That batch was folded into the pudding, and I used the other half of the carton to make another batch for the topping. A couple of months ago, a frozen dessert I'd made with Cool Whip melted, and the product turned shades of green and blue within 30 mins. I realized the 2 minutes spent making my own whipped topping was worth my family's health. The homemade version tastes fresh and wonderful, it's the same consistency, and I'm not feeding my loved ones chemicals they don't need. Thanks for the post; this goes in my keeper file."
"5","5","VERY DELICIOUS! Make sure your cream cheese is at room temperature so it doesn't become lumpy. I followed the recipe to a T except that I added the whole tub of cool whip in on accident and I'm actually glad I did. BEWARE that the whole mixture will be thin and soupy.. I was VERY conserned that it wasn't going to turn out..but I put it into the fridge and it set up beautifully! I had great compliments and I know I'll be making this again!"
"5","5","I'm reviewer 599 what else is there to say! OMG this is heaven!"
"5","5","I made half the recipe in an 8x8' pan and that was plenty for a family of 4 for 2 days. Kids LOVED it!!!  If you won't eat it within 3 days leave out bananas. Then when you serve it, serve it over sliced bananas in a bowl. The bananas turn brown after day 2 and though it tastes fine it looks not so good."
"5","5","This is so good but I do like Paula Deen does on Food Network and use Pepperidge Farm Chessman Cookies instead of vanilla wafers. Awesome."
"5","5","OH MY GOD! Well, before this recipe, I didnt really care for banana pudding. This one is Da BOMB!!!! I didnt like it before probably due to the consistency of most(wet and slimey). Well, this is the perfect blend of pudding, banana, and cookies, leaving your cookies still kinda firm. One trick I did find though, to keep bananas from turning black was to soak them in lemon juice. People really think I've really slaved for this recipe, and now I'm the official banana pudding maker of my family! SHHHH we wont tell. Thanks!"
"5","5","Tastes great. Next time, I think I will try layering more rows. I like when my wafers and bannanas are mixed in with the pudding instead of just on the bottom. While eating, it seems like my wafers and bannanas were gone well before the pudding! Layering rows will probably avoid this next time. But overall, this was very good."
"5","5","This recipe is really good, but I always decrease the condensed milk by half...the full amount hurts my teeth it's so sweet! We find that it is MUCH better to make it into banana cream pie by using the vanilla wafer crust here on allrecipes instead of just layering the wafers which get really soggy. I would also recommend putting the whole pudding mixture (minus the bananas) in the blender and pureeing it after you've mixed it in the mixer. It makes extra dishes, but gives the pudding a light, mousse-like texture."
"5","5","Great recipe! With the cream cheese a little soft to began with it really only took 15 minutes to prepare for the fridge. Smooth, creamy texture, it didn't turn out to be too sweet as I feared.  It fed 6 adults and 6 kids and all gobbled it up! (All for only $7.00...can't beat that!!)"
"4","5","I love this recipe and make it as written. However, I hadn't made it in a very long time and I tried it again recently, and it turned out like soup. I'd made it before and it had come out great, so I knew it had to be something I'd done wrong. What I learned the hard way is that you must make sure to use INSTANT pudding mix for this recipe. I suspect that what happened to many of the people this didn't turn out for is they did what I did and accidently used COOK & SERVE mix instead. It's an easy mistake to make."
"4","5","This disappeared from the dessert table at our Easter dinner faster than I could've imagined it would. It was incredible! I layered with extra bananas and vanilla wafers in a trifle bowl. I'll definitely be making this recipe again."
"4","4","THE RECIPE WAS GREAT!!!"
"4","5","Love this stuff. This gets requested for every event I get invited to. It never goes to waste! I would be sick of making it by now but it's so easy to do."
"4","5","AWWWESOME!! This pudding is the bomb. I will never make banana pudding any other way. Truly decadent, but worth every bite."
"4","3","I have made this recipe 'as is'. It is very rich and creamy. I thought it tasted like 'pudding' that you mix from the box along with cream cheese. You hardly taste the bananas. I know this isn't like the traditional banana pudding. The traditional one does not call for pudding mix."
"4","5","OMG, this was a big hit for Thanksgiving dinner."
"4","2","the taste of the pudding base is OKAY but for $6 bucks for the condensed milk and cream cheese it is not worth it, the condensed milk waaaaaaay overpowers the whole thing ,tastes like condesned milk pudding, i tried another recipe with just 8ounce sour cream 2 cups milk 1 package pudding and container of whipped for the pudding base and it was much better and cheaper than this, will not make again"
"4","5","I made this for a family dinner and had 3 different people at 3 different times tell me this was the best banana pudding they had ever ate! This is fantastic! I didn't change a thing except I crumbled Nilla Wafers on top. I have already been asked to make this again for our next family get together. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"4","5","Best banana pudding recipes out there, hands down."
"4","5","I made this according to the original recipe and it turned out great! This is the richest, tastiest banana pudding I have ever had in my life. Thank you so much for posting this recipe, Patty!"
"4","5","I personally don't like banana pudding, but I made this for my husbands co-worker & my co-workers & EVERYBODY loved it!!! I had to give this recipe to two people at work!! & So incredibly easy!! The only thing different I did was I put a layer of cookies & than a layer of pudding & than repeated with a layer of cookie & layer & banana & than topped it with a layer of pudding. & decorated the top with left over banana & crackers. I left the cool whip topping. Will definitely be saving this recipe & making it again! :)"
"4","5","I made this without bananas (they had gone bad) and it was still very good. I used reduced fat cream cheese and skim milk and you would never know. The recipe was a bit sweet with a whole can of condensed, you may want to cut back if you don't like your desserts overly sweet. Update: Made again and with the bananas this time and only 1/2 can of cond. milk. This recipe would be great w/ a layer of chocolate pudding to mimic Italian ice box cake. Next time..."
"4","5","Excellent and easy!! So so good!"
"4","5","Absolutly divine!"
"4","5","Fantastic banana pudding."
"4","5","Super simple! Rich and effortless! Whole family loved it!"
"4","5","I made this for a party and I recieved sooo many compliments. Was delish!! I made a few changes.. I used 2 small boxes of vanilla pudding and I lined the bottom with vanilla wafers and the top with the chessman cookies. This recipe is very close to Paula Deans recipe so you know its good!!!!!"
"4","5","Very yummy! Decided to make this because the BF's mom makes such a bangin' version that I had to try to make it - I was craving it! This is right ont he money! I have a bag of pudding mix, so I added about 3/4c of mix to all ingredients and it was perfect. Love it!"
"4","5","I only had white chocolate pudding, graham crackers and heavy whipping cream. So I made the graham crust with coconut for a little something special. This is a hit with everyone - you can't go wrong."
"4","5","Very easy and very yummy! My mom's recipe calls for the sweetened condensed milk and the cool-whip, but not the cream cheese - thought I'd give it a try and was not disappointed! I still think I like Mom's better, but doesn't Mom do everything better?? :)"
"4","5","Definitely Awesome"
"4","5","Very yummy! Everyone loved it and it didn't last very long!"
"4","5","Made this as is, no changes. Easy & everyone loved it!"
"4","5","This was a hit!!!Kids loved it!"
"4","4","Good recipe, however the sweetened condensed milk made it too sweet for me."
"4","5","I have two things to say to people who have reviewed this recipe. First of all, to those goofballs who claim the recipe doesn't work (is soupy, etc), you're nuts. I'm not a cook by any stretch of the imagination and this stuff turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly and it set up very well. It was actually starting to set up by the time I got the bananas sliced and in the dish. So, whatever you're talking about, you're crazy. It's almost an idiot-proof recipe. Prep time says 30 mins, but it only took me about 20...and it still turned out perfect. If you follow this recipe and it didn't set up for you, then you don't belong in a kitchen. Second, to those people who add reviews and give the recipe 5 stars, but change ten things about the recipe...don't! If you're going to change 25% of the recipe, just submit your own recipe. This recipe was FAST and EASY just the way it's written. In summary, the pudding set up perfectly when the recipe was followed exactly as written AND it tastes wonderful when prepared as written."
"4","5","The rating says it all. I made them in individual bowls. I put down a wafer then sliced bananas, pudding, cool whip and topped it with another wafer."
"4","5","I received many compliments on this banana pudding at my church potluck. Basically every husband asked me to send their wives the recipe! The only changes that I made were very minor. I used French vanilla pudding and I made homemade whipped cream in place of the whipped topping."
"4","4","Yum! This was a hit, and so good. I would only make it again if I were serving a large crowd because it made so much and is very rich. It's something you want to try and eat within the first 48 hours after making it because eventually the bananas will turn brown and the wafers will go soggy. Pretty good though:)"
"4","5","Excellent!!!! Even my husband loved this! I followed the directions exactly! It doesn't need any modifications!"
"4","5","This is the Banana Pudding that would do real well at a potluck/get-together: 1)Because of its consistency after chilled. It will keep its form and not get runny or too messy.  2) SIMPLE and quick to make. 3) Inexpensive to make yet can feed a crowd. 4) Tastes good - no surprises"
"4","5","WOW! I made this for someone's 50th birthday here at the office and it went in about 10 minutes after the word was passed of how good it was. I did not change a THING! It was the BEST and got rave reviews!!"
"4","5","HOLY COW!! My taste buds will never be the same. Followed the recipe verbatim. Wouldn't change a thing. This exceeds it's 5 star rating!"
"4","5","Amazingly easy and versatile. For those health-conscious folks, it converts to low-fat ingredients beautifully. I added toasted coconut to the top for extra yummy goodness. Delicious!"
"4","5","I've made this recipe over and over again, and am finally posting a comment.  Growing up in the south I have had my share of banana pudding. This one, though, tops my list. In fact, it was my first attempt to ever make it. My friend and family LOVE it when I make this.  I follow the recipe exact and it always comes out perfect.  All I can say is this Thanksgiving I am making 4 batches. Nice to see that there are reusable/disposable casserole containers available these days so you don't feel so bad making it and not having to get your dish back.  I do believe the cream cheese makes this dish. It is my favorite by far.  Good luck!"
"4","5","I had some serious cooks challenging my assertion that I used an instant pudding mix, and that I used reduced or no-fat cream cheese, milk and cookies."
"4","5","Excellent recipe. I used a 3oz. French Vanilla pudding with a 3oz. Banana Cream pudding for a little more banana flavor. My family and friends can't seem to get enough! We love it!"
"4","5","This was a huge hit both times I made it. It's easy, no baking, and makes enough for a potluck. This is one that I will pass down to my kids and grandkids. A real winner."
"4","5","Awesome!!!. this was very easy to make and everyone loved it.I used lite cream cheese and lofat or fat free cool whip instead of the regular. You'll never miss the calories."
"4","5","The BEST banana pudding I've ever made! I've made it with banana pudding and vanilla pudding...we prefer vanilla. This recipe makes alot, but it won't stick around long. I took some to work and it was devoured in minutes. My family loves it too. I highly recommend it! This recipe and the Tandy Cake recipe are 2 of my all time favorites at allrecipes."
"4","5","This is an awesome dessert! I tested it out on my family: they loved it! I made it for a potluck at work: Major hit! Thanks for a winner!"
"4","5","AWESOME! Everyone will ask for the recipe! I followed the advise of others and cut back on the sweetened condensed milk and I also used light whipped topping and 2% milk."
"4","5","Awesome! I made it for work one day and everyone raved and asked for the recipe! I've followed the tips and used 1 small box vanilla and 1 small box banana pudding and it was great that way too! Either way, make it. You won't be disappointed, neither will your guests!"
"4","5","This was fabulous and so easy. I cut in half for my family of three and it was gone in one day. I saw a lady making the same thing on the food network and raving about it. She used 'chess' cookies instead of vanilla wafers."
"4","5","This recipe was a HIT!!! I substituted a graham cracker crust (homemade) for the wafers. Pure heaven, It really was great."
"4","5","This is awesome!! I've fixed it twice for work parties and it's always been the biggest hit."
"4","5","This is a wonderful variation on the traditional Nilla wafer recipe -- much easier and smoother tasting. My whole family loved it. The recipe make a lot of pudding. I doubled it and had too much pudding."
"4","5","I TRIED THIS RECIPE FOR A LUNCHEON AT WORK. IT WAS SO POPULAR THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY EVERYONE. I HAD TO BRING ANOTHER ONE TO WORK THE NEXT DAY, SO THE ONES THAT DIDN'T GET ANY WOULDN'T BE UPSET. IT IS DELICIOUS, AND EASY HONEST!!!!  GERT!!!"
"4","5","I made this for my work this past friday,doubled the recipe and it was gone before I could get any!TAMMI,MOBILE, ALA"
"3","5","This recipe is awesome! Very delicious. The only thing I changed was the amount of milk...I did only 2 cups instead of 3 because I didn't want to risk it being too soupy. I'm not sure if it actually would have been, but the pudding set nicely with only 2 cups. A lot of the reviews also mentioned only using half the can of sweetened condensed milk, but I used the full can and it wasn't too sweet at all...just right actually. (And I'm the kind of person who doesn't like really rich desserts, I'm a purist, and if I'm satisfied then you know it's okay to use the whole can).   Also, one tip: refrigerate this overnight before serving it. That allows the flavors to really settle in and come through. I ate some only about 4-5 hours after I put it in the refrigerator, and it was fine, but the next day when I had some, the difference was night and day. The banana flavor had seeped into everything and it was so good. I'll definitely be using this again!"
"3","3","It was good, but not enough to end the search for the 'best banana pudding' by our own personal tastes. I thought the cream cheese was slightly heavy and overpowering. I did make this recipe exactly as written."
"3","5","I made this and it turned out awesome...."
"3","5","Eazy-Peezy....Came out Perfect!!??"
"3","5","Easy to make and delicious! Thanks for the recipe :)"
"3","5","très bonne recette.."
"3","5","My friends and family love it when I make this, instead of vanilla wafers I use chessmen cookies the cookie do not go soft as fast as the wafers. Excellent recipe !!"
"3","5","Wonderful, basic, no-fuss recipe using common ingredients! The only tweak I made was to blend a mashed, very ripe banana into the pudding. Everyone loved it and it disappeared quickly. Thanks Patty!"
"3","5","A great recipe. Super good and easy to make!!"
"3","5","The only change I made to this recipe was adding extra bananas and wafers. This is an excellent recipe and it's super easy to make. I have had warm banana pudding and it's delicious but so is this cold version. It was seriously so good. My boyfriend and I both loved it. We ate on this for like three to four days. The bananas did get brown but I didn't mind. I give this recipe five stars and I definitely recommend making it!"
"3","5","I made this for my boyfriend and the men he works with, asking them to tell me if I needed to keep searching for a better banana pudding recipe. I received an emphatic 'NO! Don't change a thing. It's incredible just the way it is.' I guess that means this is my new go to banana pudding recipe."
"3","5","Made half of the recipe... mmm mmm good!"
"3","5","I've made this recipe several times and every time I make it,it seems to get better. For someone that loves wafers throughout the pudding, try the mini wafers. My wife and co-workers ask for it all the time now"
"3","4","This is yummy for banana lovers. I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because it doesn't mention that the cream cheese needs to be softened to room temp.! That may be a no brainer for most people, but people like me who take recipes VERY literally, (especially when they've been reviewed by 1000+ people before me), look for this sort of thing. (Seriously, I checked the recipe about 3 times to see if it said to let the cream cheese soften!) So for all of you literal recipe readers out there, DO let the cream cheese sit out for a while! Everything tasted fine, but no matter how much I mixed, I couldn't get out the cheese lumps. Oh well. :)"
"3","5","Delicious and easy!"
"3","4","Halved the recipe. Used a 3.2 oz. vanilla pudding mix and subbed almond milk for cow’s milk. Otherwise made as written. The pudding mixture was good but lacked a real banana flavor which is why some reviewers suggest using 1, 3.2 oz. vanilla and 1, 3.2 oz. banana pudding mixes. We thought the whipped topping on top was a flavor distraction since half was already incorporated into the pudding mixture. We scrapped it off. This no-bake banana pudding recipe is super easy but not the most full flavored one we’ve eaten before. If made again, more modifications will be made now that I know what Patty’s version tastes like."
"3","5","I made this for a potluck at work a year ago and I still have people talking about it. It's so easy and delicious! If you make it, set some aside for yourself or you'll never get any!"
"3","5","Great pudding!! I have yet to actually eat the finished product as I just completed it and it's chilling for Thanksgiving 2012, tomorrow, as I type. However, I thought I'd go ahead and post my two cents. The pudding (after mixed with all the ingredients listed) is great! My husband and I were eating it as I was layering. I can only imagine how awesome the finish product will be. One thing I didnt do is the 3 cups of milk, I only added two. I based this on the consistency as I was adding the milk. The pudding was nice and smooth after the second cup, this could vary based on brand. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","Amazing. Delicious. So so rich though. Much smaller portions than you expect will be necessary. I forgot the vanilla, and it was still amazing."
"3","5","Loved it! The only change I made was to ensure the cream cheese was room temperature before beating. I will make this again!"
"3","5","This is great! What made it better is that I made my own whipped creamm, you really could tell the difference. Everyone loved this at the picnic-Thank You!"
"3","5","Best banana pudding ever, and really easy and quick to make."
"3","5","We just topped it with the bananas and wafers and it was great!"
"3","5","So good! Followed the recipe exactly. Very easy, quick. Rave reviews from the family gathering, young and old alike. Even better the next day! A keeper, perfect for potlucks."
"3","5","This is the absolute best banana pudding I've ever had. I don't see how you could possibly get any better. Definitely deserves a 5-Star rating."
"3","5","Very rich and simple to make!"
"3","5","The best ever. Very creamy and smooth. People ask me what the secret is to its creamy texture all the time. It is always a hit. Love how the cream cheese adds an extra dimension of flavor and cuts down on the sugary-ness that can overwhelm the bananas and other ingredients. One of the best recipes on this site, IMO. Thank you so much."
"3","5","I made this for Christmas this year and it was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly other than adding chopped pecans to the top of the finished product. It was very delicious and had a great texture.  *I recommend setting out the frozen whipped topping and the cream cheese for an hour before preparing."
"3","5","I love this recipe! I've never been a fan of banana pudding but my husband loves his mom's banana pudding. For Thanksgiving he wanted me to make banana pudding so I searched for a recipe and found this one. It was a hit! I even loved it and I have made it three times in the last month. The best thing about this recipe is that when you eat it the next day or two later it isn't runny with liquid. The combo of ingredients were still fluffy and fresh appearing. My family agreed that the banana pudding was even better the next day because the vanilla wafers were soft."
"3","5","followed directions exactly. Yum! Hubby to some to work to share with his coworkers how great this was!"
"3","5","This is the best banana pudding ever!! I make this for pot lucks at work and church and everyone goes crazy over it. I add banana slices to the pudding before pouring in the pan."
"3","4","This is very good but next time I make it I'm going to 1/2 the amount of condensed milk. If that is good I might even consider 25% of the condensed milk. The dish is really yummy but my family thought it was too sweet."
"3","5","I made it exactly as written and also used skim for the milk. It was delicious. Soften the cream cheese for about 30 seconds or so in the microwave to make it soft and easier to whip before adding the other ingredients. Next time I will use everything fat free/low fat to make it more Weight Watchers friendly."
"3","5","Delish! This is how all banana pudding should taste."
"3","5","This is a wonderful banana pudding ever. I changed the recipe just a little bit baking 2 medium bananas for 25 min at 325 degrees and added them to the mixture and the results were extra yummi."
"3","5","this was delicious, only problem was I didn't make enough! Really a great twist to the 'norm' tasting banana pudding that I usually make. Will never go back."
"3","5","definitely sweet but delicious!!!"
"3","5","This banana pudding is awesome....My son loves this It was a huge hit at his going away to the Marines cookout. Thank you sooooo much...."
"3","5","Easy to make. Just the right flavors. Everyone loved it!"
"3","5","I have tried many banana puddding recipes and this one is by far the best! The pudding is so thick and rich. Everyone loves it and some people even seem a little angry that it tastes so much like their grandmothers favorite recipe. People always ask me what the recipe is, and I will never tell! I do use 2 small boxes one of banana pudding and one of vanilla instead of the 1 (5 oz) package of vanilla. Turns out perfect every time!"
"3","5","Family loved it! Made as written except I accidently folded in all of the cool whip instead of reserving some for the top. Tasted light and creamy and entire pan was gone within 24 hours. My new go-to banana pudding recipe. Thanks Patty!"
"3","5","My family says this is the best banana pudding they've ever had! Thank you for the recipe!!"
"3","5","LOVE IT, LOVE IT! Can't wait til the family comes home to try it...If there's any left. Followed recipe to the 'T' and it was delicious. Stiffened up pretty quickly. I read a previous comment about it being too sweet and was kinda skeptical to make it. No-not too sweet at all. Thanks Patty, this is a keeper and will make again."
"3","5","I made this for my Dad once and now he asks for it on every possible occasion!"
"3","2","I made as is and thought this was way too sweet. I love banana pudding but won't be making this again. I guess others have a sweeter tooth than I."
"3","4","I had several 'on the edge' bananas around and decided to give this recipe a try. My friends and I agree: it's delicious! I did take some of the suggestions from other reviews. I only used 2 cups of skim milk and only 1/2 the can of condensed milk. The pudding came out nice and thick and was plenty sweet for our taste (would have probably been too sweet had I used the whole can). I completely spaced adding the vanilla and am sure it would taste even better had I not, but overall: I'd make it again!"
"3","5","This was my first time making a banana pudding, and I must say that his one was super-duper easy! I love that you don't have to bake it, and it uses all my favorite ingredients..cream cheese, condensed milk...YUM!"
"3","5","Okay so I'm a banana pudding fan and was looking for something distinct and good recipe for a simple yet homemade banana pudding. LOVED IT!!!! I have had this requested more times that I can count. I have however changed the recipe slightly. I used half vanilla pudding and half french vanilla pudding. It's so good. No one can say anything bad about this banana pudding."
"3","5","This banana pudding is absolutely wonderful. Nothing like grandmas but just as delicious."
"3","5","Awsome! The only thing I did was add 2 cups of milk instead of three to give it a nice thick almost custard like texture. Next time I think I will use real whipped cream instead of whipped topping just because I like it better."
"3","5","I used 1 package of vanilla pudding and 1 package of banana cream pudding as others suggested. I also made this in 2 layers - cookies, bananas, pudding, cookies, bananas, pudding, and then topped with the whipped cream. Everyone loved it! And I couldn't have been easier."
"3","5","DELICIOUS! Its even better the second day. I think I'll make it a day ahead next time because the flavors really have a chance to come out and the cookies get nice and soft. Everyone loved it!"
"3","5","I made this for 100 people ~ I used Chessman cookies. It was AMAZING! Can't wait to make it again (on a smaller scale)!"
"3","5","Awesome recipe - definitely a repeater - made for some guests and got great response!"
"3","5","This has to be the best banana pudding I have ever had! No need to change the recipe. Its perfect as is. Thanks for sharing."
"3","5","I made this using the chessman cookies as well and LOVED it much more than regular wafers! I will def make this again for Thanksgiving or my next social gathering! this is a must try for those banana pudding lovers!"
"3","5","Real good! Used Chessman cookies rather than vanilla wafers."
"3","5","Kids love it."
"3","5","Great! You must make it with 2 full layers to get the full benefit! After cutting bananas put in lemon juice or sprite soda to prevent browning. It is best if made the night before eating!"
"3","5","Really yummy. Use all Fat Free, Sugar Free, or light. To make it a little less calories."
"3","5","This pudding is absolutely delicious! I had some great banana pudding from a local barbecue joint, and I kept craving it. I found this recipe, and it is just as good as the dessert I had at the restaurant!   Just a warning, this makes a VERY large quantity of pudding. I initially bought the wrong size package of Jello brand vanilla pudding (there are two sizes, one is about 3.5 oz, and the other is 5 oz, so be sure to buy the right sized box!) I had to run back to the grocery store to buy another package when I realized my mistake. I had mixed together all of the ingredients and when it wasn't firming up appropriately, I realized I'd bought the wrong package size.  Anyway, this is a delicious recipe! I'll make it again! Very refreshing when served very cold."
"3","5","The best I've had!! This is my sure thing when wanting a quick and easy desert."
"3","5","SOOOO Yummy!!!!!"
"3","5","My husband and I made this for his coworkers.... lets just say that I didn't even get to try it. The banana pudding was obviously delicious and multiple people asked for the recipe :)"
"3","5","It was unreal the way my co-worker re-acted when I brought this to work. They loved it too much. I was actually uncomfortable. I pretty much followed the recipe. I used a large 12oz. container of cool whip, and added crumble oreo cookies to the mix. I crumbled up the oreos sprinkled, sparingly after the pudding mixture layer. Topped the remaing layer of whipped topping with nilla wafer and oreo crumbs. Served with fresh halved strawberries on the side. It made a lot and I feared I would have to take some home (dieting). It was beautiful and gone within an hour with so many request. Thank you for this receipe."
"3","5","It was the best banana pudding I have ever had! Fantastic recipe."
"3","5","Best banana pudding I've ever tasted!"
"3","5","Everyone loved it; will make again"
"3","5","Fabulous! There is nothing more to say."
"3","5","Made this as is and EVERYONE loved it!!!! It was all gone within two hours of the party."
"3","5","Simply amazing. I made an account just to express how much I loved this pudding!"
"3","5","This is a really easy and delicious banana pudding. I used half banana flavored pudding mix + half vanilla pudding mix and it didn't taste fake. The cream cheese makes this really rich and creamy. I was worried that my bananas wouldn't be ripe enough, but once they sat on the bottom of the dish for a few hours they were somehow softened and perfect. This makes a lot of pudding, so it would be great to take to a potluck. Another tip would be to add a few more nilla wafers on the top or sides of the dish. As it is, it has a nice amount of crunch and texture. An easy winner."
"3","5","I usually give away 1/2 of everything I make (so I don't eat it all, living alone and single!) but not this pie. I don't believe I've ever had a better pie at all. I thought about coming home to this pie every day while I was at work. Not to say this recipe needs revision, but I could do with twice as many bananas, but who cares? This is better than the classic. It's almost a cheesecake."
"3","4","Yummy. Good with low-fat, low-sugar options, but still high in calories."
"3","5","Made this for the super bowl and it turned out great! Everyone loved it; I will definitely use this recipe again."
"3","5","SO GOOD!!! Tried to cut fat and calories with light cream cheese and cool whip and fat free sweetened condensed milk. Still tasted great and presentation is beautiful. One of my favorite desserts!"
"3","5","I could eat this every day. SO DELISH! I didn't change a single thing!"
"3","4","I always hate when people change the recipe and then give it 5 stars...so I gave it 4. So, I didn't put in the whipped topping because I was using real whipped cream for the top and didn't want to take the chance of it watering the pudding down any. Also, I make this the day ahead of time-intentionally. Nothing better than day old banana pudding. It seems to be setting well, but I used cook and serve vanilla pudding and let it cool to warm and then added the condensed milk and cream cheese mixture to that. It tastes great."
"3","5","Delicious! Followed the exact recipe. I took the cream cheese out of the fridge a couple hours before I made this to let it soften and it blended very well. I followed suggestions of another user and blended the ingredients (prior to adding whipped topping) for a few minutes to make it fluffy and thick. I enjoyed this even more the next day. The wafers got soft and it reminded me of a banana moon pie. I brought this for a famiy gathering and everyone rangning in age from 1 to 68 loved it."
"3","5","This is very good and very rich!"
"3","4","Of all the instant pudding/gelatin/cool whip concoctions my mother would make us kids eat (suspended canned fruit cocktail, anyone?), she never, ever made anything this good. I like the change in texture of the wafer cookies working with the sliced bananas once the pudding mix does its magic... still not crazy 'bout the flavor of instant pudding tho...but this was rather good for an out-of-the-box and into-your-tummy kinda dessert."
"3","5","Cream cheese made batter lumpy -- but I was mixing by hand, so took more work. Boy, was it worth it! This is delicious! Added lots more bananas soaked in a couple tablespoons of lemon juice."
"3","5","This is by far the best banana pudding I have made. I followed some others advice and use 1 vanilla and 1 banana pudding. So easy that my 3 year old can almost do it herself. Thanks!"
"3","5","Amazing!"
"3","5","Its a great and super easy dessert. The only thing I changed was I didn't layer it. Oh and I used 8 bananas I cut them up and mixed them with the pudding mixture to have a better chance of getting some in each bite. I highly recommend"
"3","5","GREAT RECIPE!! This banana pudding is the best. I followed the directions but I also made some changes. Whipping up the cream cheese was difficult, so I did fill my sink up with 4-5 inches of hot water and put the cream cheese in a metal bowl and it was SO much easier. I also used an extra 3.5 (small) vanilla pudding package, but other than that it was terrific! And ofcourse like everyone said, it is better the next day."
"3","5","Very good and easy!!!"
"3","5","My pudding is now better than Granny's. Thanks!!"
"3","4","This banna pudding is very good! The only thing I didn't like was it was too lumpy, otherwise I would give it five stars. I brought it to Thanksgiving and it was a hit, no one seemed to care it was lumpy, I guess I was the only one who noticed. Will defiently be making again for more holidays!"
"3","5","I love this pudding! I've made it several times and followed the recipe exactly."
"3","5","This is our new family favorite. I wouldn't change a thing! We always make a huge batch of it because it tastes so darn good!!"
"3","5","Best Banana Pudding I have ever had!!!"
"3","5","I was a little skeptical about this recipe because there was a lot of condensed milk in it but it turned out perfectly. I will say that you should let the pudding chill for a good while so all of the flavors have time to come together and so it will become thicker. I let it sit overnight and the next day it was great."
"3","4","Love it :)"
"3","5","Everyone who has tasted this has loved it! Even those that don't like bananas. It waa way to soupy and thickening up so I added another box o pudding and the entire container of cool whip. I think that worked well because im sure it help tone down the sweetness of the sweetened condensed milk so I'm glad I made the additions. Another recipe I saw called for milk and pudding ro be mixed together separately I think that may be a good idea to avoid lumps but all in a deliciousness even with the additions I had to make."
"3","5","I made this last night exactly as written. I made it for a family get together we are having tonight. I just tasted it and it so good! Awesome! Five stars!"
"3","5","This was so good and very easy! It does make an awful lot though so I think next time I would cut the recipe in half and use a smaller dish. Even my husband enjoyed it....his only complaint...the cookies on the bottom got soggy if you don't eat it the same day. Thanks!"
"3","5","This recipe was so easy and quick to make. I only added 7 or 8 oz of the sweetened condensed milk and 2 1/2 cups milk. I am wondering if anyone has tried making it without the condensed milk - I don't think it adds much besides sugar and pudding has enough in it to make the dish sweet enough. I also toasted some chipped pecans and put it on top. Also - I read a few reviews where they said the pudding mixture was runny. It will be if you add skim milk - if using skim start with 2 cups of milk and before putting it on the wafers put it back in the fridge for 10 minutes. Then check how firm it is. If it is too thick you can add a bit more milk. But even making just regular pudding out of the box does not turn out as well with skim or 1% so you have to add less liquid."
"3","5","Delicious! Make sure you cream the cream cheese very well, and at room temperature. And be sure to use very cold milk! I think its best to cream in the other ingredients little by little, one at a time. I also recommend using only two cups of milk, as the pudding will turn out thicker, fluffier, and richer that way. All in all, a great recipe."
"3","5","OMG!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! So good and so rich! The only thing I did differently was sprinkle crushed nilla wafers over the top instead of spreading a layer of cool whip on top. Everyone loved this pudding!!!"
"3","3","This pudding tasted wonderful--make sure you read how many ounces of pudding you're buying. At first it was like soup--and i re-read the directions and realized i had only used 1-1oz packet of sugar-free pudding. I had to run to the store and buy more. By the end, it was a way too thick. I guess too thick is better than too thin. Next time i will use only 3oz of instant pudding. Great flavor...but not sure it was worth all of those calories."
"3","5","This is amazing! Creamy and decadent. I followed the directions to a T and it came out fantastic, Two things to remember: Make sure cream cheese is at room temp and I used the whole box of wafers (my taste) and it was great! Will definately make again!!"
"3","5","I've been made this a lot and everyone loves it! To me it's a southern banana pudding. Here is a tip to save it if it to lumpy from the cream cheese. Blend it in the blender. Will be perfect everytime!"
"3","5","Ok, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because the flavor was amazing and I see that my results were an outlier...but...for all of you who followed the recipe EXACTLY as I did, read all of the reviews cautioning against cream cheese that was too cold or milk that was not cold enough etc etc....yes mine was very soupy. My ego is in the toilet right now. Though I am not a professional chef AT ALL I consider myself a pretty good cook, at least I can follow a basic recipe. SO, who knows what the problem was. I live in the Northeast and it's winter so perhaps my house and all of my appliances/the cream cheese at room temperature was not room temperaturey--enough. Oye! Will try again later."
"3","5","This was DELICIOUS!!!! I did not change one thing, as is this recipe is a keeper!!!! FANTAASTIC!"
"3","5","Just like the banana pudding my mom and aunties make! very easy and always comes out perfect!"
"3","5","I've made a recipe very similar to this for years and it was always well-received. Adding cream cheese to the recipe gives it a little more creaminess as well as extra calories but when I do make this, it is for large gatherings. I do not recommend making this at home for small families as you will sit and eat it all by yourself! I do recommend making it a few hours earlier than when needed to allow the banana flavors to permeate the dish."
"3","5","This was my first time making banana pudding, and this recipe is great!! I read through a lot of reviews first, and did the following... I beat together the cream cheese, and 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk, then added 1 small box vanilla pudding mix, 1 small box banana cream pudding mix, 2 cups milk, and cool whip. I used the mini vanilla wafers. I layered them on the bottom, 2 sliced bananas, pudding mixture, more cool whip, and topped with mini wafers. So cute!! YUM!! This was gone in no time!! Will make again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","Great Recipe. I hate to admit it but it's better than my mom's. I would NEVER tell her that but this one is great. I did you 1 3.4 oz. box of instant vanilla and then 1 3.4 ox. box of instant banana cream pudding. I really like the extra banana creamy flavor. :-)"
"3","5","Wonderful banana pudding I made this for a lunch and everyone wanted the recipe."
"3","5","I've made this recipe 6 times and it always gets great reviews. Adding strawberries, sliced kiwi, and blackberries helps balance out the sweet taste and makes for a wonderful presentation. If you are in a hurry you can stick the dish in the freezer for half hour instead of refrigerating it."
"3","4","I did something wrong, after I added the milk, pudding and vanilla the cream cheese just wouldn't blend. It looked like curdled milk. I put it under the stand mixer for about 10 minutes and got the lumps out. Very, very rich though. It made 2 'puddings' in pie pans...perfect for keeping one at home at taking the other to work. Used 1 box regular pudding and 1 box sugar free."
"3","2","3 cups of milk and 14 oz. of condensed milk is way too much liquid."
"3","5","HOLY WOW! This is bar-none the best banana puding I have ever had!! Everyone went nuts, when they were done, the gathered around what was left and dug in with their spoons!  Changes - DEFINITELY tastes better the next day DEFINITELY delicious with 1/2 French vanilla and 1/2 Banana instant pudding And used a little more than 2 cups of milk rather than 3 - the consistancy was perfect!"
"3","5","DON'T CHANGE A THING IN THIS RECIPE!! The key to a creamy, smooth filling is to mix it on medium/high in your electric mixer until all lumps are gone. I thought this dessert would be good, but I was blown away by how totally extraordinary is was. DELICIOUS! The cream cheese, whipped topping, condensed milk, pudding mixture is very custard/cheesecake like. It is to die for! I would recommend that you make this the day before and refrigerate overnight so the vanilla wafers can soften up a bit. I will make this dish over and over again. It was the easiest thing I made out of the entire meal, and my favorite! Note: the bananas will begin to slightly brown after about 24 hours, so eat quickly! I don't think that should be a problem at all!!"
"3","5","Easily the best banana pudding I've ever had. The cream cheese adds a certain something special not found in other banana puddings."
"3","5","If you are looking to land a husband, make this! I already have an incredible husband but men love this banana pudding. I am asked by the guys to bring it to every event. The cream cheese and condensed milk really add something special. I make it as is and I don't change a thing. This recipe even made my big brother brag on me. Thank you!"
"3","4","The taste of the pudding is Excellent! Next time I am going to put less whipped topping on the top, maybe just leave it off all together.. it took away from the taste of the pudding"
"3","5","Excellent! The only thing I did differently was to not put the whipped topping on the top. Instead, I crushed up some more Nilla wafers and crumbled them on top. I used this for a catered event and had nothing but rave reviews. Had to make, at least, 30 copies of the recipe."
"3","5","This was a great treat, My family loves banana recipes. My kids loved this Banana Pudding as well. I had to tell them to stop eating it!"
"3","5","SIMPLY A GOOD RECIPE....EVERYONE LOVED IT --I AM GOING TO TRY THE PUDDING WITH BLUEBERRRY PIE FILLING FOR TOPPING AND STARWBERRIES NEXT ....I DID CUT DOWN ON THE CONDENSED MILK ALSO"
"3","5","This is the most perfect no-cook banana pudding recipe. It was just delicious. So rich and flavorful. My family and I really enjoyed it. Really quick and easy to make. Just make sure the cream cheese is room temperature so it is easier to blend. ENJOY!"
"3","5","Loved it! Very easy to make and very Yummy!"
"3","5","I made thius pudding twice and 4 days well actually 3 beause i did make this for my dad too. Everyone that i told about this recipe loved it"
"3","5","Absolutely wonderful! Some changes I made were only using half a can of the condensed milk, (I also used fat free condensed milk to make it slightly healthier lol), and I made my own whipped topping using heavy cream, confectioners sugar and vanilla extract. It turned out fabulous. My husband and I finished it off in two days - just wait until we have lots of children, it probably won't make it past an hour!"
"3","5","Better to make a day ahead. I thought it was good the day I made it, but once the flavors set in, it was excellent on day 2 or 3."
"3","5","This was sooooo yummy! I had a whole bunch of whipping cream left so I decided to make this for a Super Bowl party. What a HIT! I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will definitely use only a 1/2 a can of the condensed milk, not like it wasn't great with the whole can but just to make it a little less sweet. I used skim milk and it still tasted awesome so maybe even low or not fat cream cheese next time. This will definitely be one of those recipes I'll keep forever!"
"3","5","Wow! My Grandma has always made the best banana pudding but I think I like this one even better. The texture is very thick and rich and the taste is just incredible. I think it is the cream cheese that adds a little something extra. This only lasted two days at my house and I will be making it again really soon. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"3","5","This is a quick and easy recipe. To avoid splatter, I beat the cream cheese, condensed milk, pudding mix, cold milk and vanilla in a blender. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Then fold in the entire 8oz whipped topping. Arrange as instructed, then chill."
"3","5","The key to this recipe is to follow it exactly. Do NOT use fakey banana flavorings. The pudding has to SIT overnight in the fridge to develop the REAL banana flavoring. If you eat it the same day it is an oversweet mess.   This has been the recipe that is requested at all of my family functions. I guess I have made it my 'signature dessert' recipe. If you follow the directions BEAT THE CREAM CHEESE COMPLETELY FIRST BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT STEP! This can RUIN the pudding and you will never get the consistency back."
"3","5","I heard about this recipe from a friend who made it for her family. Of course, in my mind I'm thinking, 'OK, thanks...but the family recipe that I grew up with and have used for YEARS is much better.' Well, on a lark last night, I decided to try this. Everyone in the family thought this was the best thing they've ever eaten! I guess I'm tossing the old family recipe. Please don't tell my grandma!"
"3","5","Excellent!!"
"3","5","WOWZA. I've only tried banana pudding three times and hated it every. single. time. However, out of nowhere I began craving it...although I'm four months pregnant, so that may have something to do with it! I found this one, it was raed the most and the highest, so I figured if any banana pudding would ever be palatable, it'd be this one. I am so thrilled I tried it. I am a banana pudding convert! I didn't change anything except I didn't use the vanilla extract because I couldn't get my bottle open! It was still one of the best tasting things I've put in my mouth. Thanks!"
"3","5","Outstanding recipe. I cut the sweetened condensed milk in half and used a 3.4 oz French Vanilla pudding and a 3.4 oz Banana Pudding mix. I also folded in the whole 8 oz of Cool Whip. I chose the French Vanilla Cool Whip. Pudding turned out nice and thick and rich. It ws a great hit at work. Definitely the best no cook recipe I've tried."
"3","5","Great recipe. I used 6 bananas and 1 package french vanilla and 1 pack of banana pudding mix. I only used 2 cups milk and it came out thicker. This was very good. I will be making this for Thanksgiving."
"3","5","Fantastic recipe! I added 4 oz of sour cream and doubled the pudding ( 1 packet french vanilla & 1 banana). Outstanding - will make again and again..."
"3","5","Awesome! I read ALL the reviews and used 1 box banana pudding and 1 box french vanilla pudding and cut the milk down to 2 1/2 cups versus 3 cups. Next time I think I would use a large cool whip container (12 oz) versus the 8 oz container. I had trouble spreading only half an 8oz container across the entire pan. It was a huge hit! Thanks for the recipe!"
"3","5","Yummy!! Yummy!!!! Fantastic recipe! Following advice of others, I used 1 small pkg ea of french vanilla & banana puddings mix. Increased bananas to 8 & I tossed them with lemon juice & a little sugar to keep them from turning brown. I lined a row of vanilla wafers(standing) against the inside of the dish. Was the best banana pudding I've ever eaten. My husband & guests raved!"
"3","5","I have fixed this dessert twice. It is really, really good. The 1st time I layered in a large bowl as I could not imagine putting it in a 9x13 dish and being able to cut it. (I thought I would have to 'scoop' it.) As just my husband and I were eating it, I was amazed how nicely it remained solid in the refrig. for several days.   The 2nd time I put in a 9x13 and took it to a family gathering. It cut nicely and was easy to lift out. Everyone loved it and some could not resist a second piece.I had to take an empty dish home!"
"3","5","I hate banana pudding....but LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recpie. I use the large box of instant pudding and an 8 oz package of cream cheese. Try it also with sliced strawberries with the bananas and with strawberry cool whip. YUM"
"3","4","I wasn't as impressed as everyone else. It was good, but I've had better. I think I might try bannana flavored pudding instead of the vanilla next time. It is very easy to make though!"
"3","5","No one ever knows this is not a cooked pudding! I always get loads of compliments! I put 2 of the smaller packages of pudding in mine, and I like the French Vanilla best."
"3","4","tasted good but was too liquidy. not thick like how pudding should be."
"3","5","I was looking for a dessert that would win me that blue ribbon at my family reunion this Sunday, and I think I have foud it! This is AWESOME!"
"3","5","This is the best banana pudding I have ever tried. I have made it for several functions and I take copies of the recipie with me because I know I am going to be asked for it."
"3","4","this was too sweet for most of my family, but i thought it was very good. in the future, i will make the pudding in a bowl instead of the pan, so that it will create layers, and add another banana."
"3","4","So easy, quick, and so delicious! I tried it with French Vanilla pudding. I had to buy two small boxes of pudding so I just didn't put all of the second box in. It turned out perfect and was sure a hit with all my family. It will be one of our family favorites I am sure."
"3","5","Glad I licked the beaters after I made this for a potluck, because it disappeared as soon as I set it down. Everyone loved it! I got so many compliments I had to make another batch for my family to try since none of us got any! We agree with everyone else! It's simple and easy to make, easy clean-up, and a delicious! It's always good to have a 'sure thing' recipe to rely on for the next potluck. Thanks!"
"3","5","My husband went absolutely wild over this, and I have to admit I liked it a lot too. He ask me to please make it often. He just couldn't stop eating it! It was yummy! Suzy"
"3","5","I thought this was a great recipe! My taste buds thank you =)"
"3","5","This was a delicious recipe. I cant want to make another one. I doubled my recipe and made enough for several people. I gave one of the puddings I made to a family friend and they loved it. It can be a bit rich on the first day but once it sits- the second day it tastes like heaven. Allrecipes hasnt failed me yett!!! Ohh and dont use all of the condensed milk- it would be way to sweet. Also use half banana cream and vanilla pudding- gives it more of a banana flavor."
"3","5","Went over great at an office potluck."
"3","5","When I made this, I used more bananas and almost the whole box of vanilla wafers. Very easy to make. Next day I took in to my office's potluck and it was completely gone within minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"3","5","Very good. My husband always bragged about his grandmother's recipe, but he says this one beats all. It has to be good!! Very creamy. Plan on making this over nd over and over. THANKS!! Natalie"
"3","5","My husband had a hankering for banana pudding, but we couldn't find the right recipe to make any. We thought the Nilla Wafers box would have one that was quick-and-easy, but no. Finally found this one at allrecipes.com. It's wonderful! Highly recommend."
"2","5","I used the exact recipe and it was great"
"2","5","I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was a huge hit. I made it for my book club and they still talk about it , weeks later. I'll definitely be making it again."
"2","4","Amazing Texture and the Taste with Tue sweetened milk is magnificent"
"2","1","I think there was to much milk with 3 cups."
"2","5","I make this recipe for every potluck we go to. I don't make any changes, just follow the recipe, and it turns out perfect every time. I have had people who don't like banana pudding ask for the recipe."
"2","5","Decadently wonderful...this is my all-time favorite recipe. Growing up in the South, people always prided themselves on their ability to cook five staples of Southern Cuisine: Fried Chicken, Banana Pudding, Grits, Collard Greens, Homemade Biscuits. I have tried many versions of Banana Pudding, & this is by FAR the best. Very flexible recipe as well, as I subbed leftover yellow cake for the vanilla wafers & it was even better! Try this one...it is a winner!"
"2","5","Love this puddin'!!!"
"2","5","Outstanding as is. Don't change anything. Been making for years!"
"2","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it was everything I was looking for! It's quick, easy and so delicious!"
"2","5","Excellent! Took this to my girls 'get together'and we loved it. I used Pepperidge Farm cookies. To the people who did not have it set up. It was because you did not use INSTANT pudding. Should you find you bought the wrong pudding just cook it on the stove, let it cool some and pour it in."
"2","5","Best Banana pudding i have ever had. The whole family loved it. No left overs because my husband and father in law had 2nd and 3rds...I was bummed that i didn't get 2nds. Next time i am going to double the recipe."
"2","5","Absolutely love this and so did everybody else... but a trick my grandmother taught me was to use plastic or anything besides metal to slice the bananas the metal does something to the bananas and turns them brown a lot faster then normal and before u even put them in the dish they turn brown yuck!.."
"2","5","I'm the person who hated Banana Pudding until I tried this recipe and now I love it."
"2","5","Really like this recipe. It's easy and big hit for company. Very sweet though so I whipped my own cream and left out sweetened condensed milk."
"2","5","This recipe is awesome! I have made it several times and it is always a hit with friends and family. For the people saying it is runny, it sounds like you aren't beating the mixture long or fast enough. It starts out kind of soupy but the more you beat it, the smoother and fluffier it gets. I use my stand up mixer so maybe that's why I never have an issue."
"2","5","My husband loved it. Made it twice. It does make a lot of pudding so use your big bowl. I make it before I go to bed, put it in the fridge over night. That way the cookies soak up some of the pudding."
"2","5","The first time I made this, I used generic ingredients. That was a big mistake! It wasn't a good texture and it had a powdery taste to it. The second time I made this, I used name brand ingredients and it was heaven! Hmmm good :) Do not use generic ingredients!"
"2","5","I followed the recipe and found it to be really soupy. The soupy pudding was delicious, though, and we ate quite a bit of it with vanilla wafers. The problem was that I used 'cook and serve' pudding instead of 'instant' pudding. I found a small package of vanilla instant pudding and mixed the whole thing in. In about two hours my pudding mixture looked like cheesecake filling. It was that thick. Although I thought it was a little too sweet with the whole can of milk, we all really enjoyed it. I will definitely be making it again."
"2","5","Made it exactly as directed and did not change any ingredients. Everyone absolutely LOVED it :) Thank you for sharing the recipe! :)"
"2","5","Great recipe. Using less of the sweetened condensed milk does keep it from being too sweet. For those of you that have soupy results my guess is you used the cook and serve pudding instead of the instant. That is apparently a pretty common mistake from the reviews. Make sure you check your boxes before making it!"
"2","5","CAUTION: Make sure your pudding is 'INSTANT' and not 'COOK & SERVE'  I was following the recipe exactly (minus the condensed milk- I only added a little more than half instead of the whole can). I got to the part where I was supposed to fold in the whipped cream and realized that there was no way that was going to happen since all I had was a thin, soupy liquid. THAT'S when I realized that the pudding I bought was 'Cook and Serve,' not 'Instant'!   I'm thinking a few other people may have done the same without realizing it. I thought all was lost since I was already so far into the recipe, but I had used the last of my cream cheese so I figured I'd give it a try and cook the pudding mix/milk/cream cheese/vanilla mixture anyway as the pudding box instructed since I had nothing to lose. I cooked it until it boiled/thickened, then I chilled it in the fridge. Once it had cooled and set, I continued the recipe from where I had left off and folded in the whipped cream. It's the first time I try this recipe so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but it looks good and taste great, so I guess that's all that matters :)"
"2","5","Best banana pudding recipe ever! Very addictive ...couldn't stop eating."
"2","5","I made this for a party and it was a big hit."
"2","5","AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","This is a much requested dish from friends and family. Only change is that I make my own whipped topping instead of using cool whip using 8 oz of whipping cream and add all to the pudding mix. I also add a meringue to the top just because my grandmother always did to hers. Also, I place my cut bananas into 7up soda to soak for a few minutes to keep them from turning brown, works with apples to without that sour flavor. Lastly, making the night before and chilling overnight makes this even better. Great recipe!"
"2","5","I have virtually no culinary skills; but this recipe has some fooled into thinking I inherited some of my Southern family's skills (I haven't).   I've made this many times over the last 4 years and the leftovers never go home with all begging for the recipe.   My suggestions for success (based on some of my failures) are:  1. Make sure the cream cheese is soft, I've dunked the intact package in a bowl of warm water for a quick soften and it's worked fine.  2. Make sure to thoroughly mix the cream cheese and condensed milk otherwise the pudding will be lumpy. Very important in my family as some members 'hate' cream cheese and wouldn't eat it otherwise, as it stands they gobble up this recipe none the wiser.  3. Make sure to use the instant pudding otherwise you will have vanilla soup.  As for substitutions, I've replaced many of the ingredients with lower fat/sugar options all with great pudding. Low fat cream cheese (can't spell the real name), fat-free condensed milk, diet vanilla pudding, lite whipped topping. The recipe works fine with any and all of the above."
"2","5","Very good recipe! Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe for the most part but followed some of the other reviewers advice as well. I used a pack of vanilla instant pudding and banana cream instant pudding, as per the other reviewers, and I wish I didn't. It gave it an artificial banana taste to it. I did put the bananas in a diluted lemon juice mixture so they wouldn't brown. I also crumbled wafers on top of it. I would just recommend not changing any of the ingredients!"
"2","5","For those of you having trouble with the pudding being soupy, as another reviewer said, you are probably using 'cook and serve' pudding instead of instant. I made this mistake too, but then just boiled the mixture for a minute, and it thickened. I also used 1/2 banana and 1/2 vanilla pudding and this tastes like the dish my southern family used to make-- and the stuff I can pay $6 for down the block in NYC. Great recipe."
"2","5","Absolutely Amazing, and I'm not a sweets fan! I couldn't get enough of this."
"2","5","I used to make the banana pudding recipe in the Nilla Wafer box-as did my mom. It was traditional and I didn't like any other recipe, until now. I used this recipe a couple of times and it is a hit in my house. It is quick, easy and tasty. It is my new fav dessert go-to."
"2","5","There is nothing wrong with the recipe. I make it often, this was my first time trying it with cream cheese. Some are saying the pudding was runny. Try one of two options:let it set in the fridge for 20-30 minutes (as if making pudding), first before folding in the whipped cream; or using mixer, beat it until it sets then fold in the whipped cream. Here's what I did, I mixed the pudding and 3 cups of cold milk along with the condense milk. I then mixed the cream cheese in the pudding mixture and once smooth, covered and placed in fridge. While waiting for it to set, I sliced the bananas. Once pudding is set I folded the entire 8oz of whipped cream into the pudding mix. I then layered the wafers and bananas along with the pudding, in a 2.5 quart dish it's a little over 2 layers."
"2","5","This recipe is amazing. I took it to a potluck and it received rave reviews!"
"2","5","Banana Pudding is my husband's favorite dessert and he said this the best one he's ever had. I am not typically a fan of banana pudding, but the cream cheese in it really won it over for me. We will definitely be making this one again. Thanks!"
"2","5","I am back to obtain the ingredients to make this again. There were no leftovers. I made this for my 2 year olds family dessert and it was a huge hit. The only change I made was to add 5 instead of 4 bananas and I made sure the cream cheese was at room temeperature. Thank you for a favorite family dessert."
"2","5","This is the BEST ever!!!!! Make it PLEASE! You will want to forget dinner and go straight to dessert! YUM YUM!!! You will lick the bowl, it is that delish! Served it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! The only secret is to make it the night before you have it if you can stay away from it!"
"2","5","My aunt is known for having the BEST banana pudding at our family functions, so I decided to show her up with this recipe and boy did everyone love it! My mom was so upset with me last Thanksgiving because there was none left for her to enjoy. I follow this recipe to the T always and its never a disappointment. The only thing I sometimes do different is crumble the vanilla wafers vs. putting them in whole due to small children. Besides that, this will always be a family favorite and will forever remain in my recipe book, even when I start my own family. Thank you!"
"2","5","I make this recipe as is. I may sometimes add a few more bananas or more cookies (because I like the pudding softened cookies, so I put more in!) but I don't think that really changes the taste. I do find that sometimes it seems like it makes more than others...I can put it in the same dish & sometimes it overflows & sometimes it is perfect! But I think that may be something to do with how much air I get in it when mixing. I sometimes get an extra tub of whipped topping too & put some in a piping bag to decorate the top of the pudding. This recipe has replaced one of our pie options at Thanksgiving!   If it came out soupy, make sure you're following the recipe. You folks that are complaining about it not coming out right & in the same review explain how much you revised the recipe are just comical.  This is not a 'lite' dessert by any means. It's sweet. It's rich. It's yummy. It's comforting. (did I mention it's sweet?) If you're looking for a banana pudding that's not too sweet, keep looking!"
"2","5","The only two changes I made were I used Chessman cookies instead of Nilla Wafers and I cut it down to 2 cups of 2%milk instead of 3 just because of personal thickness preference. I have to say this recipe is the greatest I have 3 banana pudding maniacs in my home and they are fighting over it!!! Thanks for making me the kitchen hero!!"
"2","5","Yummy! I modified (no sweetened milk): I blended cream cheese with 1/2 cup of evaporated milk. Once fully blended, I added maple syrup to taste. Then I added 1/4 the container of whipped topping, then the pudding, then the final 1/4 of whipped topping to make a fluffy, mouse-looking pudding. It was le drool. Tastes more like cheese cake, and is less sweet intense, with the maple adding a bit more dimension of flavor. We also passed on the cookies (forgot to buy some), so used sliced almond slivers on top of whipped cream on top for crunch. ;D"
"2","4","This pudding was extremely rich and delicious."
"2","5","Delicious  Little changes  8OZ 1/3 less fat cream cheese  1/2 can of Sweetened condensed milk 2% milk 2 cups and 3OZ vanilla pudding   It's the first time I made and the first time I am trying it...thanks :) delicioso"
"2","5","Great recipe!! I made it for my husband to take to work and I have requests to make it for the company picinic now and also requests for the recipe."
"2","5","First time making banana pudding! My family raved about it. I just added a few more bananas & dipped the slices in lemon juice to prevent browning. I'll definitely make this again!"
"2","5","Delicious! after reading other reviews, I used 2 cups of milk instead of 3 and also used an 8x8 glass dish. Made a nice thick texture. Will make again and again. So sweet and rich. Not an overpowering banana taste and is great for those with a sweet tooth."
"2","5","My first attempt making true southern style banana pudding and it was a success because of this recipe! My only substitution was to use previously posted suggestion to use 3.5 vanilla pudding and 3.5 banana cream. So creamy and yummy the day that I made it and it was not running at all the next day! Very pleased with the outcome and will definitely make again!"
"2","5","I used two small packets of vanilla pudding and 4 cups of whole milk  ( I started with 3 cups but ended up adding another cup when it started to set up as it seemed just too thick- 4 was perfect and the amount called for on the box- 2 cups each. much better, especially since the nilla wafers absorb moisture)   I used 6 bananas and the whole box of cookies for 2 bowls. I made 2 complete clear straight sided bowls.  I started in each bowl, by layering the nilla cookies/banana/pudding twice, then topped with pudding/bananas mounded toward the centre of the bowl , followed with coolwhip topping, and sprinkled crushed cookies over the top. Delish. Next time i will use even less cookies though- they kind of absorbed the pudding too much - my fault for using so many.   In short, go long on the bananas, short on the wafers ( 1/2 a box per the recipe prob just right) , long on the pudding. The cream cheese, condensed milk, and cool whip unbeatable combo. Remember to use fruit fresh (or lemon juice and water) to keep bananas from browning."
"2","5","This was the hit of my dinner."
"2","5","Wow, just wow. This is one of those special recipes that everyone will rave about! So good, and so easy!"
"2","5","This is the best recipe I have found on this site. I have made this too many times to count now. Sometimes I use the condensed milk, and sometimes I don't. It's great either way. Thanks for sharing!!!!"
"2","5","Exciting! I will admit, this is my second dessert I have ever made and I am happy it came out so well! I made this recipe for a little luncheon at work and I was a bit nervous especially because I'm new at the place. Everyone liked it! You really can't mess this recipe up. However, I did by putting the cool whip in the freezer and having to deal with ice-creamy whipping haha. Oh, and I only had a spatula to mix with - no electric mixers of any kind but I managed to get the cream cheese decent after killing my hand! haha I will definitely be making this again!"
"2","5","I fed all my neighbors for our Weekly Casserole Tuesday meal, and all of my neighbors LOVED IT! There was none left!!!"
"2","5","I love this recipe but I changed it just a tad. I add one jar or banana baby food into the cream cheese and cut mild to 2 and 1/2 cups."
"2","5","This is a great recipe. It became an instant family favorite. I am asked to make it all the time. I took lots of suggestions from other reviewers. I sued half a can of condensed milk. I combined one 3.4oz packet of french vanilla and half of the 3.4oz packet of banana cream instant pudding mix. That way there is no artificial banana flavor. Just a hint in the background. I used the whole package of vanilla wafer and a bit more bananas. Thank you so much for sharing."
"2","5","Made this a hour ago and I gotta say it turned out awesome!! Was absolutely delicious. The extra step that gave me definitely improved this from the last time I made it."
"2","5","love it!"
"2","5","Decadent and oh so sweet! Mmmm! My whole family devoured this."
"2","4","VEry good, I used a packet vanilla and a packet of cheesecake and next time I will mix bananas all the way through it. I layered the top with sliced bananas and wafers. And then when I served it I would have my guests crumble some more wafers on top which was exquisite!"
"2","5","Best banana pudding ever! I've made it four times and always comes out perfect. I use 2 cups of milk& one small box of instant pudding& keep everything else the same. Perfect consistency and so delicious!"
"2","5","Easy to make, tastes great, and you can get creative with putting it together. I used a whole box of Vanilla Wafers and one and a half containers of Cool Whip. I also crumbled up some wafers to put on the top."
"2","5","This has been award winning for me in my office! Everyone loves it and I've even had ppl give me $$ to make them a batch ... Or two ... Thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
"2","5","I just made this for the Super Bowl, and it's excellent! In the one I made (9x13), I used a whole box of nilla wafers and 5 bananas. I did do more than one layers which is probably why. Thanks for the delicious recipe!"
"2","5","BIG family hit! I don't like the frozen whipped topping, so I use real whipped cream and it's great- whole family loves it!"
"2","5","Fantastic recipe. As others have noted, its important to use COLD milk, it helps to keep it light and fluffy. I used real whipped cream instead of cool whip and it turned out great, it just takes longer to fold in. Thanks for the recipe!"
"2","5","DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I'll probably add more bananas next time because I like the bananas, but other than that, amazingly delicious!!"
"2","4","It's delicious, but too sweet even for me (a notorious sweet tooth). I think it could do without the sweetened condensed milk (use 1/2 the amount of reg milk instead?) and definitely MORE bananas. I used 4 ripe ones and they were lost amidst the pudding. Also, I'd half the cream cheese. The cream cheese left almost a sour aftertaste compared to the extreme sweetness of the dish. Overall very yummy, but could do with some minor changes :)"
"2","5","loved it"
"2","1","Is it supposed to be this runny? It may be that I used soy milk BUT this isn't that good even if it was thicker. It's way too sweet. If I try to make it again w/cow milk I'd def. use less sweetend cond. milk. It's like just drinking that."
"2","4","Pretty good, a little fluffy for my taste in banana pudding, but overall pleased everyone that ate it."
"2","5","My husband has a favorite 'Meat & 3' restaurant that he goes to for lunch and has always loved their banana pudding. He says this is even better than theirs! It is delicious. I made it with exact ingredients but I think next time I'll use a little less whipped topping. But great stuff!"
"2","5","My fiancé's firefighter brothers beg for it!!"
"2","5","My daughter Loves banana pudding & was very excited when I said I was going to make it. Many ppl said it was actually the BEST they have ever had, even my daughter. But I did not add the whipped cream to the top cause my daughter does not like whipped cream. It was like heaven in your mouth"
"2","5","i made this for my family for christmas it was gone in 5 minutes next i will double or triple the recipe they are already wanting it for new years dinner"
"2","5","DELICIOUS!! I always thought banana pudding was just banana pudding & Nilla Wafers! No WONDER it was always so 'blah', haha!! Thanks so much for this, it was SCRUMPTIOUS! I used a graham cracker crust, because I happened to have one and needed to use it. Then I lined it with bananas, pudding, nilla wafers, pudding, bananas, wafers, pudding until it was gone. I also added an extra small box of banana pudding (used the original box of vanilla) because with the 3 cups of milk, it seemed pretty runny. It was a big hit! YUM!"
"2","5","This dish was a huge hit with the kids and the adults. Yummy!!"
"2","5","Yum! This turned out fantastic! I usually am not a fan of this desert either. I especially loved the pudding mixture and I wouldn't mind just making that part :)"
"2","5","So good! Made for a birthday dinner none left!"
"2","5","Easy and Delicious!!"
"2","5","Excellent! I will definitely make again."
"2","5","this is delicious! wow...ok  while using a 9x13 was fine, the presentation was muck better when i used a truffle dish (or a large tall bowl) also my friend made it with banana pudding and (no offence to her) it was repulsive. use vanilla...for the health and happiness of every one. to make it look more elegant you can crush up some of the wafers and sprinkle them on top, fresh fruit adds a more original touch but i like the more standard look of the bananas and good old nilla wafers. just a personal preference."
"2","3","Quite tasty but not what I expect from a traditional banana pudding. I love the flavors but I feel like something is missing."
"2","1","I made it for a Thanksgiving dessert this year, and it turned out terrible! I followed the recipes exactly, but I think there was too much milk involved. We ended up throwing it away. What a waste of time!"
"2","4","My 10 year old godson & I made this recipe exactly as written. It was very good & fun to assemble. He was able to cram all the cookies in. We did sprinkle lemon juice on the bananas so they wouldn't turn brown (several reviewers suggested). Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Delicious!"
"2","5","I'd never made banana pudding before. This was amazing and my family and friends loved it! I added 2 of the 3.4 packs of pudding mix, though so it was a lot creamier. Great, simply recipe!"
"2","5","Very good banana Pudding. I read some of the comments and made 2 changes. I cut my milk down to 2 cups to make it a little thicker and I used Pepperidge Farm: Chessmen cookies instead of vanilla wafers."
"2","5","This is IT... The banana pudding that everyone raves over. Perfect as it is. Remember to layer the cookies, bananas and pudding mixture and give the cookies some to soak up some moisture and melt in your mouth."
"2","5","I use real whipped cream instead of coolwhip with very good results. This has become a family favorite."
"2","5","I've made this several times and it never fails to satisfy everyone at the party. I recently made it using only sugar free, fat free and reduced fat ingredients. Still absolutely amazing!"
"2","5","Hit the spot! So easy and so good!!!"
"2","5","A few extra bananas is perfect."
"2","5","Very good! Thick & rich with the addition of the cream cheese. I used one 3 oz Jello Banana pudding and one 3 oz Jello Cheesecake packet."
"2","5","Yum! great for a crowd. Quick and Easy just like it says. It is a great recipe; it is thick and creamy. Have made it more than once."
"2","5","THE BEST EVER!! I doubled the recipe and it still wasn't enough for my dinner guests. Everyone loved it. This is definitely one of my favorites."
"2","5","This is so yummmy and easy to put together! Just 30 minutes and you've a delicious dessert ready! Since most of the ingredients are not in my pantry I do have to prepare in advance."
"2","5","Made as directed with two small changes for a little elegance..... I put about 5-6 wafers in bottom of WINE GLASS, added the banana slices and BLUEBERRIES, filled with pudding mixture with a dollop of whipped topping on the top. It made 6 full wine glass servings. A little on the sweet side, but oh soooo good!"
"2","5","This Banana Pudding is by far the best I have ever had, it has a cheese-cake type quality. It is my go-to recipe for Banana Pudding. On occasion, I use Nutter-Butter cookies in place of the wafers (from a recipe I found in Southern Living), which gives it a peanut-butter flavor, just depending on our mood! You MUST try this recipe and I thank the submitter for such a delicious dessert!!!"
"2","5","My only disappointment is that I didn't make a double recipe of this - SO GOOD!! The recipe is perfect as-is :)"
"2","5","I made this for labor day weekend for several customers(& my family)- and wow, what great feedback. Not your typical banana pudding. Very tasty and very filling. I used the vanilla pudding as stated, not banana pudding- It was great!"
"2","5","I have never had a banana pudding that was so easy and so delicious!"
"2","5","Made the recipe as is in a glass bowl (used more bananas/cookies to get a few more layers). Delicious! I beat the cream cheese at room temperature as others suggested, and even threw in some Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies to enhance the overall look. Everyone complimented the results and said it was the best banana pudding they ever had."
"2","5","The best banana pudding I've ever had!!"
"2","5","This is certainly not a low-calorie dish, but I heard no complaints for anyone who tried it. Without a doubt the BEST banana pudding I have ever eaten!"
"2","5","all i have to is this is soo good but i hate brown bananas so what I did was basically wait until i served the dessert by preserving the bananas in lemon juice to keep them from browning and serve them in layers you never taste the lemon juice and it makes the presentation that much better"
"2","5","I am now famous in my family for this recipe. I made it exactly as described, but used all fat free or reduced calorie ingredients and you can't even tell! Absolutely easy and beyond delicious!"
"2","5","Amazing, simple, and yummy! Will definitely make again."
"2","5","Very good!! We had my sister and brother in law over for dinner tonight and I made this for dessert. My sister told me her husband absolutely loves his moms banana pudding so it was going to have to be really good to impress him....well he LOVED this. Thanks for the great recipe"
"2","5","Absolutely wonderful!"
"2","5","My brother loves me for making this for him, thanks for the perfect birthday gift for him!"
"2","5","Made this recipe for my family and friends and it was a hit..Everyone loved it and even had seconds. I made it exactly as the recipe follows..I will defiantly make this Banana Pudding again,I do think next time I will add more banana.."
"2","5","This is the best & easiest recipe ever! I made this for a July 4th family get together. It was loved so much so that I am making 2 additional pans for some family to take home! I followed it to the tee...didn't change a thing & it was creamy & rich just as it was. Thanks for posting!"
"2","5","This was the most DELICIOUS pudding recipe combination! I did a few things differently tho: I used 3.5 banana cream and 3.5 french vanilla puddings, as other reviewers recommended-awesome! I didn't put the remaining half of the whipped cream on top...and I used Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies instead of Nilla Wafers. (These kick Nilla Wafer's butt-you'll LOVE the taste! Try it!) :o)"
"2","5","I made this for my husband on Father's Day and he absolutely loved it. This was my very first attempt at making Banana Pudding (I dont eat it at all) and am very pleased with the little effort required to make a delicious recipe. With my son & husband eating this daily it was gone before the week was over. Will definitely be making this for others again very soon. Thanks Patty."
"2","5","Excellent alternative to the traditional banana pudding. I prefer loads of cookies so next time I will buy TWO boxes! Rave reviews!"
"2","5","This one is my favorite of the non cook recipes. Very creamy and not too sweet. Wonderful!"
"2","5","This was outstanding!!! I also used the 'filling' directions, and instead of vanilla pudding, used lemon and added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract and I had the filling for lemon icebox pie. Yummy. Had the Banana Pudding 3 times in a month for DH."
"2","5","Sooo EASY!"
"2","5","My grandmother made banana pudding for all family gatherings and we loved it. After grandma passed away, I decided to make her pudding and it was good, but not the same. So I decided to try this recipe instead. And I'm glad I did! This is the best. Yes, better than Grandma's pudding. We now have a new recipe for family gatherings."
"2","1","Incredible...don't change a thing!"
"2","4","This was soooo good! I've never made banana pudding before. My family loved it! I used a small box of vanilla and a small box of banana cream. Next time I think I'm going to use only vanilla and I think I'm going to omit the cool whip. Oh and we used the whole box of nilla wafers :)"
"2","5","Awesome!! I was eating it before I had the chance to put it in the fridge to set..lol. I love this pudding and I am glad I came across this. This is a wonderful dessert. I used the entire box of nilla wafers, 3 bananas, skim milk and it was yummy!!"
"2","5","I decreased the condensed milk by 1/2 because its a little too sweet w/ the whole can. I also used all fat free ingredients. Amazingly good!!!!!!!!!"
"2","5","This is great! I tweaked somethings though.  I made the pudding as directed but instead of slicking the banana, I waited till the end and chopped the bananas into cubes and mixed the bananas into the pudding.  I set up the vanilla wafers and pudding like usual in a deep dish. But I kept some aside to use in little pie crusts I bought, they're made from Keeblers. I also topped the pudding with crushed vanilla wafers just before serving. They are SO good in the little pie crusts. My husband had duty one night and I brought him a couple of banana pudding tarts (that's what I like to call them) and he shared it with another soldier and they both thought they were amazing!"
"2","5","OMG this recipe is 'bananas'...I was already making a banana pudding that my family always requested at family functions...after tasting this one, i'm throwing that old recipe away, they're gona love this one even more. I followed the recipe exactly...the only suggestion i would make is if you have time, let it sit overnight. It tasted even better the next day after the waffers softened up a little bit. This is the bomb...i cant stop dipping into it...i need counseling to get me off this pudding!"
"2","5","This is the BEST banana pudding recipe. Don't change a thing!"
"2","5","Tasted better if you let it sit overnight."
"2","5","The Best...."
"2","5","absolutely amazing! i went to a party, there were 4 other deserts there and mine was the only one that had non left. i will be making this again and again! Whoever came up with this recipe deserves a hug."
"2","5","My family is in love with this recipe! Thank YOU!"
"2","5","Made this on Monday and sent some with my hubby to work he works as a K9 trainer for the AF, needless to say it's all gone. Got all kind of raves. Thank you"
"2","5","Really good, really easy. I used half vanilla pudding and half banana cream and I used a little more than 8 oz of cool whip to top it off but otherwise great dessert"
"2","5","My husband is a banana pudding fiend, he was unsure when I told him I way trying a new recipe. But he is glad I did! This Banana Pudding is amazing, rich and creamy and perfect :)"
"2","4","This was a good recipe. I did not give it 5 stars because because I did not like the texture compared to other banana pudding recipes I have tried."
"2","5","I have to make this recipe for every family occasion and at least 1x a week..thanks"
"2","5","I made this recipe solely because it was so highly rated on this website. I'm typically more of a chocolate person - bananas just don't do it for me. But WOW. The Vanilla Wafers just absorb the moisture from the bananas and the pudding and it almosts comes out tasting like a moist cake. I used the sugar free fat free vanilla pudding and low fat cream cheese. Still fabulous."
"2","5","If you love bananas you will love this. Such an awesome banana-ree flavor. I left this dessert to sit overnight."
"2","5","Great Recipe! So easy to make and Soooooo delicious!!!"
"2","5","Made as directed. Delcious. Best prepared a day in advance to soften the cookies."
"2","2","This was way too sweet for me, and I LOVE desserts. I was looking for this type of recipe, but this was just too sweet. Next time, I'll just make vanilla pudding and add bananas and Nilla Wafers. Thanks for sharing, though! Obviously I'm in the minority, not liking this recipe. :-)"
"2","5","I really liked how creamy this pudding was. It tasted just right to me. The flavors were delicate, suggestive and not overwhelming."
"2","5","This was the best banana pudding I've ever eaten! My husband enjoyed it so much! With every bite he said 'Mmmm...' And thats ALWAYS a good sign! I followed this recipe exactly like it said. :)"
"2","5","I made this a week ago and am still hearing raves over it."
"2","5","great recipe, my family loves it!!"
"2","5","I followed some of the suggestions on here, using one 3.4 oz package of French Vanilla putting, and half of a 3.4 oz package banana pudding. This did NOT add any sort of fake banana flavor, as was suggested by some. It was fantastic. My husband has been a banana pudding fan since he was a child...the old fashioned cooked variety. He raved about this, saying it was the best he's ever had. Next time I will make it with real whipped cream instead of the Cool Whip."
"2","5","Wonderful recipe, I wouldn't change a thing!"
"2","5","Very good and easy!!!"
"2","5","All I have to say is YUMMY!!!!"
"2","5","Wonderful! This is my go-to banana pudding recipe! Delish every time!"
"2","5","The Best ever Banana Pudding I have ever had...It is a take-along to covered dish get togethers!!"
"2","5","I made this for one of my work pot-lucks. My only regret was not making enough. Some people didn't get any at all. But those who did really, REALLY loved it. I had to promise to make more for those who didn't get any."
"2","5","This is wonderful! I was worried because it said to 'beat' the ingredients, and I don't have a mixer/beater. It tastes awesome, though, even if you just use a fork :)"
"2","5","If I could give this more than five stars I would. This is so simple to make and my guests did not stop raving about it at Thanksgiving. I spent hours making a fancy pie and they wanted this simple pudding instead. In fact they even requested I bring the leftovers to another family gathering the next night. This was a big hit!"
"2","5","Fantastic! I made this for my stepfather and he said it was THE BEST banana pudding he has ever had! I followed the directions exactly except I did not spread the whipped topping on top - I used a little for garnish, but that's all. Everything tasted great the 2nd day too. I would recommend you make sure to use a hand mixer, not a stand mixer--I started out with a stand mixer and I don't think everything would have been incorporated well enough if I continued with the stand mixer. Make this pudding! I don't even really like bananas and I thought this was great!"
"2","5","This was a fan favorite! I didn't put the extra whip cream on top because it was smooth and tasty enough. Really turned out good!"
"2","5","perfect as is and everybody loves it."
"2","4","Really good. A little sweet."
"2","4","we had this tonight made as said well I made it l;owfat but anyway i believe you need TWO packages of pudding. my son and husband loved it"
"2","5","too good"
"2","5","Followed this recipe exactly as written and it was excellent!! Thanks so much for sharing :)"
"2","5","IT was delish! MY family loved it and it was easy to make."
"2","5","This was worthwhile to make and quite delicious. My boys loved it!"
"2","5","I made this for a church dinner and everyone love it."
"2","5","This pudding was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. My husband's family loves banana pudding and they couldn't stop raving about this! It was even better the second day. It would be yummy with some chocolate shavings on top! This recipe is a must!"
"2","5","People have told me over and over again that this is THE BEST Banana Pudding they have ever had. I get requests to bring it to BBQ's all the time. TRICK to NO LUMPS is to fill your sink with about an in. of Hot Water and set mixing bowl in it to warm up. Then Cream Cream Cheese in Bowl till smooth. Then mix in sweetened condensed milk and so on...I always atleast double up the layers so I use 2 containers of whipped cream. Its alot but Hubby can eat it all by himself in 3 Days! Must Be Good! :)"
"2","5","this banana pudding is so delicious!! i've followed other banana pudding recipes before, but this is the best one so far...i didn't change a thing...a definite keeper...this will be my new go to dessert for potluck/parties. thanks for sharing :)"
"2","5","Yummy. Per other reviews, I used 2 1/2 cups milk, and the consistency was perfect. Next time, I'll use half a can of sweetened condensed milk (a bit too sweet for my liking). Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","Yummy!! Q even liked it."
"2","5","Delicious! I followed recipe exactly except used 3 bananas. I am glad I used the 3 cups of milk instead of 2 like other reviewers had said. It does seem like a lot of liquid when your mixing but once it is refrigerated and sets it comes out perfectly. I did not think it was too sweet either. I will definitely be making this for family gatherings and potlucks at work. Thanks for sharing."
"2","5","I just moved to the south from Wisconsin. I brought this as my first attempt at a typical 'southern dessert'. Everyone at the dinner said that mine was much better than the woman who always was responsible for bringing the banana to this function. She had leftovers and I didn't. :)"
"2","5","Best ever!!!!!!"
"2","5","Excellent! East! Loved by all!"
"2","5","Wonderful! Used 2.5 cups of milk - perfect. Used only half the can of sweetened condensed milk and reduced fat vanilla wafers. No one would ever know."
"2","4","Made recipe as is without changes and it was a good recipe."
"2","5","Love this dessert! I used 1/3 fat cream cheese, sugar free pudding, and skim milk. I didn't find it to be that sweet and maybe it's because of these substitutions. I thought it was just sweet enough. I also used a whole box of vanilla wafers, making sure to cover the entire bottom and then lining the sides of the dish with them. The next time I make it I will use more whipped topping on top...perhaps another whole 8 oz. container. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I love it!"
"2","5","I thought this pudding was too sweet but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours the flavors came together. The crowd of young 20 something guests went wild over it"
"2","5","Loved it! I made this recipe for dessert for my Bunco group. It was wonderful! I'd make it again in a second. I used a deep glass bowl instead of a casserole, it was quite the presentation."
"2","5","I used 3 large bananas, that's what I had on hand. Folded 8 oz fat free cool whip into filling, didn't put any on top. Delicious!!! The kids loved it!"
"2","4","I've had this type recipe before and it is a very tastey recipe, but my pudding mix seemed a little too thick. I used 2 small pkgs of pudding one banana and one vanilla as suggested. I think I will add extra milk next time and less of the condensed milk as also suggested for less sweetness."
"2","5","OMG.. this thing taste so good and I felt like having the whole thing. I didn't add Vanilla Extract because I don't use it on any of my food but other than that.. This is the best dessert after Flan.. Make sure you add Milk before the pudding mix and make it the night before, the banana flavor spreads over night making it even more delicious!!!"
"2","5","Excellent - I made this for xmas dinner and it was wonderful.....I got up the next morning and ate 2 bowls for breakfast.....everyone asked for the recipe"
"2","5","I made this for a party and everyone loved it. It is very easy to make and tastes wonderful."
"2","5","This was so delicious and easy to make. i've never been a fan of the instant pudding recipes, but this one was great. I would definatley recomend putting it in a bowl so that you can use more layers and i reduced the milk to 2 cups. other than that, i wouldn't change a thing. Has anyone tried this with pineapple? i'm tempted."
"2","5","This was the best banana pudding recipe I've ever tried. My sister even said it was better than the one her hubby's grandma used to make and that had her #1 seal until now. This is my hubby's favorite dessert and he LOVED it! My only change was adding a couple of fresh very ripe smashed bananas to the mix & then I layered it in a trifle bowl, otherwise followed exactly. Thanks so much for sharing this fabulous pudding."
"2","5","Very easy and very delicious. 'Nuff said. :)"
"2","5","This is the best banana pudding recipe I've ever tried. I beat the sliced bananas in with the pudding so it has a more banana flavor. So creamy and rich. I have also tried it without bananas, but using banana instant pudding instead of vanilla, and it was really good too."
"2","5","Wow! I have made this recipe several times and just wow! I don't change a thing except I use more wafers because I layer it in my trifle dish. My husband thinks I hung the moon when I serve this up. When I need to convince him of something, I whip up this little dessert and it puts him in a receptive mood ;)"
"2","5","I thought this was really wonderful. I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I divided it in half (it does make a large amount) and fixed half like the recipe said (but with more bananas). The other pudding half I put in the fridge and fixed a couple days later like the recipe said (again about double the bananas). Loved it! Will definitely be making again."
"2","5","This was fantastic!! I followed some of the other suggestions such as only using 1/2 the can of condensed milk and using a couple of extra bananas. I also used 2 boxes of banana flavored pudding although next time I think I'll try one box of banana flavored and one box of vanilla flavored. In any case it was so GOOD and so EASY--a perfect combination!"
"2","5","I made this today and I had to up the servings to 50. Even at 50 servings it was super easy and very very yummy. I forgot to include the cool whip into the pudding mixture but I added as a layer and it was good like that. I will making this again in future. It was all gone lol."
"2","5","I only used half a can of sweetened condensed milk so it wouldn't be over the top. This was soooooo good! I was a believer in cooked banana pudding only but this is my new go to!"
"2","5","Awesome! I made this for a church function and got tons of rave reviews. Now my go-to recipe for banana pudding."
"2","5","This has become my signature dish! We aren't invited to a get-together unless I agree to bring the banana pudding!"
"2","5","I used one vanilla pudding and one banana pudding mix for this and I think that's best. My boyfriend ate all of it over the course of a week. I myself don't like banana pudding at ALL but he said it was great! Thanks for a lovely recipe!"
"2","5","Listen carefully PLEASE.DO NOT CHANGE PERFECTION, because this recipe is PERFECT just as it is! We absolutely loved it! I've never liked Banana Pudding until I tried this recipe. It's absolutely the VERY BEST. AND REMEMBER FOLLOW IT EXACTLY and you won't be disappointed."
"2","5","This is rich but amazing By far the best banana pudding"
"2","5","Very good recipes, I add blueberry, rasberry and slice strawberry along with banana. Cant get enough of it :)"
"2","5","DANGEROUSLY good.I made this for my mom but almost ate half of the darn thing by myself and im on a diet!! Another 5 PLUS star recipe. So easy and SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!"
"2","5","This was a really great and very easy recipe. I used two small boxes of french vanilla pudding. I also didn't have nilla wafers so I used coconut cookies. They complimented the pudding very well. I took this to a 4th of July thingy and everybody loved it. I added cookie crumbs to the top"
"2","5","Truly, you know it's going to delish when it starts with condensed milk and cream cheese. OOps! I layered the wafers on bottom before the bananas (pudding not able to soak into wafers) --- so I turned the banana pudding upside down into a larger dish and IT STAYED TOGETHER! -- I was able to remove the cookies and push them into the pudding longways. I am providing a photo (taken with phone) -- but you can see the extra glass and that the pudding didn't move. It is gorgeous and delicious."
"2","5","My family went crazy for this! Ate the entire dish. So good. Will be using this recipe often!"
"2","5","Excellent!!"
"2","5","Great recipe, but it's a rip off of Paula Deans not that that makes a difference in the taste."
"2","4","This was a good recipe, however I found it to be overly sweet. Next time I make it, I will leave out the condensed milk all together. I would suggest leaving it out, or adding it in a small amount at a time, tasting it as you go. Other than that, it was a good dessert!"
"2","5","My family went bananas over this! So easy to make and so good!"
"2","5","Soooo yummy! Like some others had suggested I used 1 small package of french vanilla pudding and 1 small package of banana cream pudding. I am really glad I did because I would have missed that extra banana-ish flavor. I used half the can of evaporated milk to cut down on the sweetness, though I realized that wasn't necessary since the nilla wafers and bananas aren't very sweet. I'll probably use the whole can next time (and next time will probably be very soon)"
"2","5","I have made this recipes several times and have always had great results. Due to the number of diabetics in the family, this is an easy recipe to reduce the sugar and/or fat on by simply using sugar free pudding, fat free cream cheese, skim milk, and fat free sweetened condensed milk. Even with the low sugar/fat, I have always gotten good reviews."
"2","5","This is decadent! When we make one, we have to make two or three more, and eat it until we are ill! It's very easy to divide up while preparing into small containers to give away! Ga! This is one you go to the all-night grocery store for the ingredients."
"2","4","Very good, but a little too sweet. I will try only half of the sweetened condensed milk next time. Thanks"
"2","4","This recipe was good the first day..but REALLY GOOD the second day! I would definately make it the day before if I was taking it to a party. A definate four star, but not quite the big five star that I was hoping for."
"2","5","This was incredible I'm still enjoying it thanks so much for the recipe. I accidently bought cook and serve pudding instead of instant so I mixed it all up and cooked as directed on the box and it turned out fine. Thanks again."
"2","5","I make this all the time & my kids (hubby, too) can't ever seem to get enough! The only thing I change is I scale back the milk to 2 cups and use the low-fat or fat-free variety of the cream cheese, condensed milk & frozen whipped topping -- same great taste without quite as much guilt and girth! I layer everything in a large rectangular pyrex cuz it makes it easier for the kids to serve themselves."
"2","5","One of my husband's favorite desserts. I made mine in a trifle bowl (was brand new and I was dying to use it). This is the first time I made it with S.C. milk though."
"2","1","I own a cataering business. Made this for a New Years Day party. What a big gloppy mess. Made it the day before and by the time I served the pudding, it had broken down to a yellow puddle. Had to remove it from the table."
"2","5","Wow! This is absolutely the best banana pudding recipe I've ever made!"
"2","5","I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I heard comments like,'This is the best banana pudding I have ever tasted.' I followed the advice of several others and only added 2 cups of milk which was perfect.I put it in the refrigerator the night before and it cut like a dream the next day with no runny mess. Will do this again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"2","5","Absolutely awesome! I made the recipe as it is written except used about half the can of condensed milk. Do not use banana flavored pudding! There is more than enough natural banana flavor!"
"2","5","Oh sooo good! It made a lot of dessert so be ready to share with more then a couple people."
"2","5","EXACTLY what we wanted! Turned out perfect! Thank you!"
"2","5","I made this recipe for a large party over the weekend. It was a complete hit! I used peppridge farm chess cookies instead of vanilla wafers for something a little different. Had to give out reicpe to many at the party!"
"2","5","This didn't last long at the party I brought it to. I used a small package of vanilla pudding and 1/2 of a small package of butterscotch pudding with just 2 cups of cold whole milk (instead of 3). Great flavor! Makes a lot!!!"
"2","5","this looks good"
"2","5","I made this with just a few changes and everyone loved it. First I crushed about 3/4 of a box of Nilla wafers, added about 2 TBSP melted butter and pressed into the bottom of the dish then lined outside with whole wafers. I also made sweetened whipped cream (worth the time) rather than whipped topping. Excellent recipe!"
"2","5","I thought this was great! I made a few changes to make this a little more low calorie. I used 1 fat-free cream cheese, 1 fat-free sweet condensed milk, 2 small packs of sugar free cream cheese pudding, 3 cups skim milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 fat-free container frozed whipped topping, 4 bananas and 1/2 pachage reduced fat vanilla wafers. I used the cream cheese pudding because I was afraid the fat-free cream cheese might be too light in flavor. Everyone at the party loved it and didn't even know it was reduced fat!"
"2","5","I made this recipe without any changes or additions. It was a huge hit at the July 4th cookout we attended this year!"
"2","5","SUPER good! Better the second day,"
"2","5","This recipe was really good. I actually subsituted all low-fat and low-sugar ingredients. I used light cream cheese, sugar free pudding mix, fat free condensed milk, fat free whipped cream, and low-fat Nilla Wafers. I was afraid that the lower fat ingredients wouldn't congeal well, but it was nice and creamy just like it should have been. It was delicious and very easy to make."
"2","5","This was probably one of the best banana puddings that I have ever had! Followed the recipe to a 'T' and it turned out great!"
"2","5","Excellent! I loved the vanilla pudding. I thought is was perfect as is. Why do so many people change recipes? I did put mine in a trifle bowl because that was the only dish I had on hand. Made it the night before serving as well. Very tasty. Everyone saw it as a comfort dish."
"2","5","YUMMY! I have never been a big fan of banana pudding but for what ever reason I was craving it the other day. I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try since it uses vanilla pudding instead of banana flavored pudding. I did toss my bananas with some 'fresh fruit' to keep it from browning. This was wonderful and the whole family really enjoyed it! Thanks!!!"
"2","5","YUMMY!!!!! It was SO SO SO SO GOOD!!! I LOVE Banana Pudding!!! It was the best I have EVER had!!"
"2","4","Tasty but not spectacular. I used butterscotch cookies as vanilla wafers are not avaliable here."
"2","5","Gosh darn, we loved this recipe - even better than my Southern Mamaw's! I don't like to review a recipe that's been altered but I did take the advice of others and used 1 small package french vanilla pudding and 1 small package banana pudding. I ran out of regular milk and had to substitute about 1-1/2 cups half and half. Used a trifle bowl and made about 4 layers. I put the remaining whipped cream and crumbled vanilla wafers on top. Made a gorgeous presentation and everyone 'oohed and aahed' when I brought it out. Thank you so much for this recipe!"
"2","5","I've tried many Banana Pudding recipe, but this is definitely the best tasting as well as easiest."
"2","5","My niece wanted banana pudding for Easter dinner so I logged on and printed out this one based on the ratings. We were not disappointed. I made it the night before and I was surprised that the vanilla wafers were still crunchy. I put them around the edges like in the photo and it was pretty. Next time I might do it in a trifle bowl. My only suggestion would be to chill the pudding before you frost with the remaining Cool Whip so that you're not just incorporating more Cool Whip into the pudding (need a firmer surface to spread on). Yum, yum, yum. There was carrot cake and ice cream on the buffet table too and everybody ate my pudding. Need I say more?"
"2","5","Best ever!"
"2","2","I was very disappointed. Nowhere in the recipe did it state to dip the bananas in lemon juice. By the time I was ready to serve my bananas had turned black it was not very appealing"
"2","5","YUM, perfection! This is the best recipe for banana pudding. Only change I made is used almost a whole box of wafers. I brought this to work and everyone wanted the recipe! I crushed some wafers and sprinkled them over the top, looks beautiful and tastes delicious!"
"2","4","Really good! But maybe too rich, next time i'll add more bananas and cut down a little bit on sweetened milk..  still, a keeper!!!"
"2","5","OMG! this is THE best banana pudding i have ever tasted! to all the people out there looking for a recipe...STOP! look no further because there isnt a better one out there. the only thing i changed was i didnt put the whipped topping on top. crushed waffers... either way, yummy..thanks!"
"2","5","this tasted better than I imagined! Tastes just like a banana cream pie! Wow!!!"
"2","5","FYI - While this is very good, almost this exact recipe is in Southern Living"
"2","5","I have been making my banana pudding this way for a long time....it is the best!!!"
"2","5","Just follow the directions exactly!! I put crushed wafers on top. YUMMY!"
"2","5","To the youngatheart reviewer, maybe you added evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk. Evaporated milk has the consistancy of milk, but condensed milk is thick like a sauce. I noticed your profile mentioned that you are a beginner. It's easy to mess something like that up when you haven't been cooking long. : ) Otherwise, I thought the recipe was delicious and simple."
"2","5","family loooooved this. There was none left."
"2","5","This is to die for!!! Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing. Keeper for sure - no changes needed."
"2","5","I love this recipe. Was nice to find the recipe again. Its so simple and quite the crowd pleaser.  I don't use the vanilla at all as my mother never used it. I beat the cream chees with the sweetened condensed milk first THEN I add the other ingredients. This recipe doubles perfectly...just use a LARGE mixing bowl!"
"2","5","This banana pudding was the best ever!!! Super simple and great tasting. I can't wait to make it again;)"
"2","5","This recipe was incredible. My husband hates it when I make a big fuss for his birthday, but he said that I HAVE to make this every year for his birthday. I made it just the way the recipe said and it's absolutely delicious. The BEST banana pudding I have ever had!! Two thumbs up to the creator!!!"
"2","5","Excellent recipe! I prepared it fat free - with fat free cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk and milk. Still creamy and sets well."
"2","1","I loved the flavor, but unfortunatly I did something wrong, because it was like soup and never took form. (I have no idea why, I read all the tips)I made this for my boyfriend who LOVES Banana Puddin, but never wanted any because it was like soup."
"2","5","This is excellent and easy to make, get many requests for the recipe. I think the vanilla extract adds a lot. and it is best with vanilla pudding not banana creme pudding I have tried it both ways, vanilla is the best."
"2","5","Absolutely perfect. I made it just as the recipie instructed and we loved it. It was so rich and thick, the way a Banana Pudding should be. We just finished eating it and I already want to make another one. I have a feeling this one will become a family tradition."
"2","5","This is a very good recipe!The more you mix the more air is incorperated making the batter fluffy, which was a hit in my house."
"2","4","Very good and easy to make my family loves this"
"2","3","This was good, but not great. The taste was good, but it was too rich. I think that it was the cream cheese."
"2","5","We got rave reviews from husbands and kids alike. I think this is a huge hit...at least in my household!"
"2","5","This recipe was a smashing success!! Everyone loved them...will certainly be the banana pudding I will make from now on. Much better than the others I have tried."
"2","5","OMG! This didn't even last 24 hours with my family of four. My son had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I prepared it exactly as recommended and I don't think I've ever eaten a tastier banana pudding. Thanks!"
"2","5","I made this for a dinner with friends. One of the guests said it tasted just like the banana pudding his grandmother used to make."
"2","5","This is the best banana pudding!! I even like this one better than my own mom's and that's saying something!! My husband has about hurt himself by eating the whole bowl himself!! Wonderful recipe..so tasty will make every time I make banana pudding now, thanks!"
"2","5","This is so yummy! I used 2 cups of milk following the previous reviewers but the pudding got so thick and too sweet that I have to add more milk later. I wonder if they used the smaller box of instant pudding? I should follow exactly like the recipe and don't forget to let the cream cheese to room temperature and beat it really smooth to have a nice consistency."
"2","5","This recipe is awesome!!! My mother-in-law said this was the best banana pudding she has EVER had. I think that is enough said. ENJOY!!"
"2","4","I was a bit disappointed in this one...I thought the cream cheese flavor would be a bit more distinct. I took this to a party and it was a hit, though."
"2","5","This is, without doubt, the best banana pudding this Southern girl has ever had! I mixed the condensed milk with the cream cheese (which was at room temperature), then combined the pudding, vanilla and GRADUALLY added the milk. I had no splashing or sloshing doing it this way. I then folded in all the whipped topping and allowed it to set while I prepared the dish/bowl with the vanilla wafers and bananas. The mixture was nice and firm by then, and I had no problem at all with it. OK, just one -- there was a ton of it! I filled the 9x12 dish and still had about 2 cups of the mixture remaining! That's the kind of problem I like. :)"
"2","5","This is the only banana pudding recipe I use. However, I felt so guilty eating it and I have so many diabetics in my family, that I had to switch some things around. I use low-fat cream cheese, sugar free pudding, lite or the new sugar free cool whip, skim or 1% milk. It is still the best banana pudding even with these changes."
"2","5","My first time making it and my family loved it."
"2","2","The cream cheese wouldn't mix in very well and the pudding was too rich and thick with it. I much prefer a lighter pudding. For a banana pudding, this doesn't taste at all like bananas."
"2","5","I made this for Christmas dessert because I didn't want anything too heavy and it was perfect. Quite yummy and kids would love it. The only thing that I didn't like was when I poured the pudding mix onto the cookies and banana slices, they all floated to the top. I don't know how to stop that for next time but the top bananas turned a little brown by the time I served it. Maybe I just did something wrong but either way, it was excellent!"
"2","4","This was very yummy! I normally just make the filling with instant vanilla pudding and top with whipped cream. This was a nice change, but not that much difference in taste than the easier version. Its just a little more time consuming than how I normally do it. I would probably alternate between this one and my original, just depending on how much time I have."
"2","5","i liked this a lot, however i can warn you not to over cook the pudding mix. this will be made several times. i can not wait to share it with friends and see what they think."
"2","5","Made this for someone at work. Everyone loved it! I was told this was mostlikely the best Banana Pudding they had ever had."
"2","5","I will never make any other kind again! I got a hug from a stranger who after eating it, told me he was from Georgia and had tasted a lot of good  banana pudding but never had tasted anything so perfect!  He told me that everyone who had tasted it wanted me as their wife, mother, sister, or new best friend! Who knew banana pudding could make you so popular?!"
"2","5","I use this recipie all the time and I even manage to convert those who say they only eat traditional cooked banana pudding."
"2","5","This recipie was a big hit with my entire family. This one is a keeper for sure!"
"2","5","This was quick, easy, and REALLY good. I used fat-free Eagle brand, neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat cream cheese), and lite Cool Whip, and half nonfat milk, half whole milk. I used a smaller, deeper pan and made two layers each of cookies and pudding. I crushed a handful of cookies and sprinkled the crumbs on top of the whipped cream. Adults and children alike thought it was the best they ever had. This is definitely a new family favorite!"
"2","4","This is very good. I will use a little less cream cheese next time, maybe 2/3 of a package. I followed other reviews and added more bananas, 2 cups of milk, and 1/2 can of condensed milk. This is a very creamy and dense pudding. Yummy."
"2","5","The absolute best banana pudding ever. I always get requests to bring it to covered dish events. I also top off with sprinkled crushed vanilla wafers for looks."
"2","5","This is the BEST banana pudding recipe. Every time I make it for a group I always get requests for the recipe."
"2","5","An excellent recipe! I doubled everything and used a 10x15 pan instead (and still had plenty left over for my freezer!). I also used both banana and vanilla instant pudding mix, and I made my own whipped cream and folded all of it in instead of reserving some for topping. Served it at a church dinner to rave reviews and several recipe requests."
"2","5","A friend of mine made this Banana Pudding and I had the pleasure of trying it. So, I won't ever make Banana Pudding the old way again. This is an excellent recipe. Very Delicious!!!"
"2","5","This was simply the most rich, tempting, and delectable banana pudding I've ever had. My whole family enjoyed it and I didn't need to change a thing. My dad is from Alabama and always reminisces about his relatives' fantastic banana pudding. I think I may have them beaten, though. I use reduced-fat options when I can and usually skip the final addition of the whipped topping. I can do without and it makes the pudding even more intense."
"2","5","This recipe was wonderful. Very rich, but also what I think of when I think classic banana pudding. Definitely a hit!"
"2","5","Absolutely delicious! The cream cheese gives this pudding a subtle flavor in the background. My store was out of the 5oz pudding so I got a small vanilla & a small banana pudding. With the addition of cream cheese & cond. milk, it makes a LOT of pudding so I was able to add another layer of wafers & banana slices. I sprinkled crushed vanilla wafers on top of the cool whip for appearance. Everyone raved about this pudding! It gets better in the fridge as the wafers soften up a little. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
"2","5","I've been making this pudding for 2 years and we love it. I add cinnamon to the batter and then sprinkle some on top to dress it up a bit. I also think it's easier to beat the cream cheese with the sweetened condensed milk because it makes it easier to mix in with the rest of the ingredients."
"2","5","I've been cooking for many years, but for some reason, this was my first time ever making banana pudding. This recipe was absolutely great and really easy. I made it for Mother's Day and both my mom and grandmother (the biggest food critics ever) were extremely pleased. If you can forget about the calories, this makes the perfect dessert! :-)"
"2","5","I got rave reviews with this - the cream cheese makes it. I folded in all of the whipped topping instead of saving half for the top, and it made the dessert lighter and even better!"
"2","5","This is a dangerous recipe if you are dieting because it is impossible to have just one bite! I reserve it for functions that I'm invited to so I don't end up eating the whole thing by myself. I personally have no self control. Thanks so much for a terrific and easy to make recipe. Everyone loves it!"
"2","5","I made this for a church function and it was a BIG hit! It is awesome. I did add more bananas and nilla wafers and it was even better the next day. Thanks"
"2","5","I made this recipe last night and it is the best banana pudding I have ever had. The only things that I did different from the recipe were to layer the bananas, pudding, and nilla wafers. I added some extra wafers too. Then as another reviewer suggested I crumbled some up on the top. Not only was it delicious...it was quite pretty."
"2","5","Delicious! I get asked to make this all the time!!!!"
"2","5","Awesome! There is never a bad word to be said when this is served. I finely crush vanilla wafers and put them on top for a little extra decoration."
"2","5","Best banana pudding I ever had. I only made a couple changes. I used 1 box of vanilla pudding mix and 1 box of banana cream pudding mix and used a lot more fresh bananas then layered in a glass bowl"
"2","5","Absolutely wonderful recipe! I would only suggest creating layers of pudding with wafers and bananas as there is an awful lot of pudding. Great taste!!"
"2","5","I have been making this dessert for years & everyone LOVES it!! It's cool to read variations that people try on it. I think I will put it in a bowl instead of a 9x13 pan this time & layer more!"
"2","4","my family love this recipe! Get ready to workout. Although next time I will leave off the extra whipped cream on top.Love layering it with gram crust on the bottom and wafers and bannas every other layer"
"2","5","Wow! This is soooo good! I'll never eat plain old banana pudding again...."
"2","5","This is the ULTIMATE banana dessert recipe! It's fast, easy, cheap, and a hit with everyone! I made it for a get-together at my house with very different tastes represented....and everyone raved! Wow! I'll be buying bananas just to make this. Thanks, Patricia!"
"2","5","This was the best Banana Pudding I've ever had. I didn't change a thing. It was just right. My husband could not stay away, my dad had two servings. My mother wanted the recipe. My 3 year old daugther helped make it, it was so easy. Yummy! Can't wait for an event to make it again. An excellent Thanksgiving treat. (Christmas and any other holiday or big dinner)."
"2","5","I made this for a potluck dinner and got all rave reviews. It was easy to prepare and delicious."
"2","5","Great recipe. Better than most banana puddings, even baked ones!"
"2","5","This IS the best banana pudding I have ever tasted. I do have one question...does anyone know a secret to help slow the browning process of bananas once they have already been sliced and put into the recipe?"
"2","4","I liked this pudding, but did not consider it as good as the rave reviews. I followed the recipe except I used 1 small (3.5 oz.)french vanilla and 1 small banana pudding, based on previous reviews. I also used just over 3 cups milk. The pudding had bits of lumps from the cream cheese but it didn't seem to make a difference in the end product. I also had trouble frosting a 13x9 pan with only 1/2 tub of Cool Whip. I felt the cream cheese was overpowered by the other ingredients; couldn't tell it was there. So it tasted like a good, sweet, banana pudding, but nothing extra-ordinary. Note that the dish held together perfect; the pudding was firm but not runny. I also sprinkled crushed vanilla wafers on top."
"2","5","This was great! My husband loves banana pudding and I scored some huge points for making it for him. It was almost like a banana pudding cheesecake. I will definetly make this again."
"2","5","Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! With a dessert recipe this good, you'll need the big bowl it ends up making. My sister and I finished the whole thing off in 3 days. Whoops. I'll make this again without a doubt. (I did use a whole box of wafers, 7 bananas, and a little less sweetened condensed milk.)"
"2","5","If you love banana the old fashion banana pudding, you will LOVE this...Just enough sweetness added to make it a true delight..."
"2","5","My first attempt and it turned out excellent. Everyone just raved!! A keeper for sure."
"2","5","After serving this pudding at my grandparents' house a couple months ago, I am now the family's official banana pudding chef. Everyone loves it. I haven't been to a family get together since that I wasn't asked to bring that dish. It's so easy that I'm thrilled to accomodate!"
"2","5","I've made this several times for my friends at work,everyone loves it.The cream cheese gives just the right tang to balance out this sweet dessert."
"2","5","OH MY GOD!! I am an Australian living in New Jersey, and have heard about banana pudding and thought i would try it. Oh my god - simply the best comfort food around. Even the picky husband really enjoyed it - will definately make again!"
"2","5","This was amazing! I would have to say...one of the best no-bake deserts that I have made. This was definietly a big hit! A must try for all of those banana lovers out there."
"2","5","This is the same recipe I have used for years. Two suggestions: let the cream cheese come to room temperature before beating and then, after beating it well, just add the condensed milk and beat those together throughly first before adding the pudding, milk, etc..This should help with the clumping. By using this method, I have never had bits of cream cheese in the finished product. I layer the wafers/bananas/pudding in two layers in a 13X9 for transporting or in a pretty glass bowl for at home. I personally think the more cookies, the better it is."
"2","4","A little bit of a twist to the same old eagle brand recipe. A bit rich, but it tastes great. Yields quite a bit, though - may consider reducing a bit if not for a large crowd."
"2","3","I didn't think this was anything special. Maybe the 5* ratings and many reviews got my hopes up. It wasn't bad, just not recipe I'll bother to make again."
"2","5","I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was incredible and easy to make. I have already been asked to make it for Christmas!"
"2","5","Comfort food at its best! Very easy to make, tasted great the next day, perfect for anyone who loves bananas."
"2","5","Wonderful, yummy, new way to make banana pudding. But an added little bonus; my elderly father, who has been having digestive problems the last few years and is VERY finicky and hard to please these days, couldn't get enough!"
"2","5","Out of this world! A definite keeper. Give it a try, you won't regret it."
"2","5","this is the BEST banana pudding me or my family has ever tried!! it is fantasic"
"2","5","the whole family loved this.. I am preg. with my 4th child and HAD to have banana pudding! :) Hubby made this for me and it was awesome!!!! thanks so much!"
"2","5","The best banana pudding I've ever had. I can't wait to make it again."
"2","4","WHAT DID I DO WRONG? It tasted delicious, but it had a soup consistency, not a pudding. I used a dry milk mixture instead of regular milk. Could this have made the difference. My fiance was a good sport and ate it anyway, but the dish never made it to the dinner party."
"2","5","EXCELLENT...The best banana pudding recipe...You'll be lucky if there are any leftovers....I crunched up vanilla wafers for the top...Yummy :)"
"2","5","Very Good! I made it in a trifle dish, but made a little mistake. I knew I was going to feed a lot of people- so I doubled the recipe. BIG MISTAKE!! I ended up with 3 banana puddings. (1 in a trifle dish, 1 in a 9X13 and one in a 8X8) But the texture was lovely and the taste was outta this world. I never dreamed I would see the day that I made a better banana pudding than my cousin- but that day has come! YEAH!!!"
"2","5","Love this!! I made this instead of a birthday cake for my fiance. I had already baked a carrot cake earlier, so this was a great alternative to the usual. I used all fat free ingredients and reduced fat Nillas. I used soy milk instead of regular and no one could tell the difference. I think I will cut the condensed milk to 1/2 a can next time...very sweet. Everyone that came over LOVED this. I will make again. A great low fat recipe."
"2","1","The pudding was refrigerated overnight and did not take form."
"2","5","I'm a beginner and this was pretty easy to make and VERY delicious! I had little trouble beating the cream cheese to get it fluffy, did the best I could then continued with the preperation, but shoudnt of done that cause I had to work on getting the cream cheese clumps smoothed out when I added all the other ingredients so my mistake. Otherwise, it still came out great, only thing was, my husband and I thought it was bit too sweet and was a very large dish for just the two of us so next time, I'll cut the ingredients in half and as for it being too sweet, I'd recommend using only half of the sweetened condensed milk. Otherwise, a came out GREAT! A delicious desert, just too sweet for us, but I'll try it again! Thanks!"
"2","5","Prior to making the recipe, I read the reviews. I wanted to make sure I had the best recipe. I use 1 small 3.5 oz box of vanilla instant pudding and 1 small 3.5 oz banana cream pudding. I also use 3/4 can of the condendensed milk as suggested. I had no left-overs. Everyone asked for the recipe. I wanted to say it was a family secret, but I shared because this website shared with me. I've put my old baked recipe in the back of the recipe box. This recipe is fast and delicious. Thanks from Ajae"
"2","5","This was such a hit! I made it for a friends birthday, and it turned out perfect. I made a couple changes, used two of the smaller 3 1/2 oz packages of vanilla pudding (couldn't find the 5 oz size), and only used 3 oz of cream cheese, but the pudding turned out the creamiest, and most delicious I have ever had. Secondly, I decided to layer the desert. Starting with a layer of Nilla wafers, then a layer of bananas, then a layer of the pudding, I reapeated this twice, and topped with the remaining cool whip, and crushed Nilla wafers. I ended up using an entire box of nilla wafers, but it was perfect. I will make this for many get-togethers!! Scarlett"
"2","5","This pudding is easy to make and tastes great. The husband loved it. Company raved and requested the recipe. I preferred to fold the bananas into the pudding. Also, I used Neufchatel, which is a softer cream cheese, and reduced milk by 1/4 cup. This is now my best banana pudding recipe! Loved it."
"2","5","Very delicious. A big hit at my office. It's also easy to make it low-fat with skim milk, fat free sweetened condensed milk, fat free or low fat cream cheese, fat free or lite whipped topping, and reduced fat vanilla wafers. I promise even the low-fat is delicious!"
"2","5","My familty loved this recipe! However next time (and there will be a next time!) I would use Banana pudding instead of vanilla, add more fresh Bananas. I would also omit the whip topping from the top of the dessert! My kids and feel we would like it with Nilla wafer cookie crumbs on the top."
"2","5","I made this recipe for a party I was having and everyone really liked it. I had never had Banana Pudding made with cream cheese and I think this really added to the taste of it."
"1","5","Great!"
"1","5","Family loved it! No leftovers. I will definitely make this again."
"1","5","took this to a birthday party cookout yesterday and it was fabulous! The only thing i did differently was mix half a banana into the ingredients before folding into whip cream (to give the pudding itself more of a banana flavor) oh, i could only find fat free cool whip and i could not tell a difference. i really enjoyed this and so did others at the party."
"1","5","By far this was the best banana pudding recipe I have tried. Completely delicious!"
"1","5","Tasty ...Yummy...Best..."
"1","5","Did not make changes and everyone LOVED it!"
"1","5","No changes made Perfect as is"
"1","3","Turned out soupy. Even after refrigerating all night. Not sure what happened. Flavors great though."
"1","5","this was the best"
"1","5","O.M.G...I don't usually write reviews but just had too...I followed this recipe to T except I used two cups of whole milk instead of three..My fiance and my kids killed it in less than a hour...My fiance who is a banana pudding fanatic stated is the best he ever had besides his grandmother's of course :-) I will be using this recipe from here on out!!! THANK YOU"
"1","5","absolutely delicious and so simple!"
"1","5","I've been utilizing Allrecipes for years, this is my first review.  I tried this recipe for today's Easter dinner. ... incredible. ...everyone LOVED IT!!!  This will be my go to banana pudding recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing"
"1","5","I pretty much make this recipe as is. The only difference is that I now use the peperidge farm chessman cookies as the bottom and put the vanilla wafers on top. I do this for the buttery crunch of the cookie, to me it is like the fabulous crust to a cheesecake. This recipe as it is written is delicious. Everyone I know that has tried it cannot get enough of it. I am required to bring it to all family gatherings. You don't have to change anything."
"1","5","Excellent, especially on the second day if you can manage to have leftovers!"
"1","5","1 word....DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","This recipe is perfect, I didn't change one thing"
"1","5","Oh so delicious! Only used 2 cups of cold milk to ensure the thickness of the pudding layer. Will be a regular dessert I bring to family functions."
"1","5","this easy dessert with simple ingredients was done in 20 minutes. I  would suggest letting the cream cheese sit out at room temperature for 20 minutes to make it easier to cream with the vanilla pudding. I only had 1 banana so I added a  pint of blueberries and 10 strawberries. It was a huge hit and served 20 people."
"1","5","This is the same recipe I make and it is DELICIOUS...Everyone raves over it..."
"1","3","This recipe was easy, the kids enjoyed it, but it was WAY to rich for me."
"1","5","Super easy and a huge crowd pleaser."
"1","5","This came out perfect! I have not been a fan of the traditional banana puddings but this I couldn't put down after making it for Christmas. I followed the recipe exactly but I used banana cream instant pudding instead of french vanilla because the store was out. It tasted even better the next day."
"1","5","I love this recipe and will definitely make it again! It was a big hit but was so easy to make!"
"1","5","Loved it just the way it is. Absolutely the best!!!! Family ate it up and enjoyed very much."
"1","1","3cups of milk?? WAY to much!! I had banana soup!"
"1","5","Made this today for my family.It was a big hit,Follow directions exactly and found nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it make you own recipe and post it. Five Stars"
"1","5","I MADE THIS BANANA PUDDING AND IT CAME OUT GREAT. I KNOW MY FAMILY WILL LOVE THIS FOR CHRISTMAS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT IT."
"1","5","This was absolutely delicious!! I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe!!"
"1","5","This is how I learned how to make banana pudding. Everyone in my family request I make it for the holidays. I follow the recipe to the letter. It came out fantastic. Making some for co-workers for Thanksgiving."
"1","5","I have made this banana pudding many times in the past few months. Every family gathering, I get a request to bring it. It's delicious as is - don't change a thing in this recipe!"
"1","5","I made it exactly as the recipe says, & my fam. loved it my husband always ask me to make it at first I was no fan of banana pudding but now... this is the only one I will eat."
"1","5","Wow! This recipe tastes absolutely wonderful! I suggest using the cooking vanilla pudding to make sure the cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk get fully incorporated with one another. This is a recipe I will use again and again. Got rave reviews from everyone AND it's nice to say, 'Just make your banana pudding recipe and whip in softened cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk' when everyone's asking for the recipe over and over."
"1","5","I have made this for my mom three times and she loves it now more than the cooking types of puddings so we now have a banana pudding we all can enjoy Thank You so much for this great recipe."
"1","5","As I made this, I sort of messed up a couple of things BUT it didn't even matter because this came out Soooo amazing. My three year old approved and told me, ' I wuv it!!!'.  I followed the exact recipe. This is super addicting to eat! Perfectly sweetened . I do see why you have to let the cream cheese get to room temp now. Will definitely not be doing that again. Thank you so much for this recipe"
"1","5","Best banana pudding ever. I do 2 layers and maybe use more whip cream, bananas and cookies depending on what size container I use. Overall, the recipe is heaven!!"
"1","5","very good! and i don't normally like things w/ bananas"
"1","4","Very good, followed exact recipe."
"1","5","I've made it just like the recipe says for a couple of years now. I wouldn't change a thing! (Even my mother has stopped making her version and started using this one!)"
"1","5","Perfect!! nuff said."
"1","5","I love banana pudding and this is the best recipe I've ever used without having to make a homemade vanilla pudding with an egg custard. Fabulous, easy, and everyone ALWAYS wants the recipe. Thanks, Patty!"
"1","5","LOVE SO MUCH"
"1","5","Super easy and yummy. Just a tip... I'd try to soften the cream cheese before trying to beat it."
"1","5","Made this recipe for the first time today. It was very easy to make and my family LOVED it! I added sliced bananas on top and set aside some crushed vanilla wafers to add to the top in case people wanted to add some crunch to their serving. It was a big hit. My pan emptied pretty quickly. I will definitely be making this again!!!"
"1","5","My first time making it and it was awesome"
"1","5","Sooo yummy.. Love how creamy it was and the cream cheese give it a kick of flavor.. So in love wit it .."
"1","5","Easy Awesome!"
"1","5","The sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese make such a big difference."
"1","5","I make this recipe exactly as written, and it is fabulous. I get asked to make this for work potlucks, family reunions, anytime! It's quick and easy for kids to make as well, since no cooking is involved. It was the only thing my father-in-law could eat while going through chemotherapy treatments, and he said it felt soothing and filled him up nicely when he couldn't eat anything else. Thank you, Patty, for posting this recipe! It's my favorite on allrecipes.com!"
"1","5","I made this recipe without any changes, and it was perfect!"
"1","5","Wonderful!!! I loved the way it set up, it was firm, unlike my usual banana cream pie, that spills all over when you take a slice out.it tasted wonderful.!"
"1","1","I am SO frustrated! Tried making this for my hubby's birthday and it's a soup! I have followed the directions exactly and double checked that my pudding was instant. Its been mixing for a good ten minutes with no end in sight."
"1","5","Great recipe"
"1","1","I was excited to try this recipe since this is my husbands favorite and I make it pretty simple so I wanted to try something new. I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it came out very runny, it was a big tray of MUSH! I will NEVER use this recipe again."
"1","5","After reading the contrasting reviews, I decided to make this exactly according to the recipe without deviating. I used 3 cups of very cold whole milk and did not allow the cream cheese to warm to room temperature in addition to being the regular (not low fat or fat free). The mixture began to thicken a few minutes after adding the milk and after folding in the whipped topping, it was quite thick.   The flavor of the mixture wasn't too sweet for my taste either. It was a hit with the family!"
"1","5","I can't believe how great this recipe is! I followed the recipe using fat free cream cheese and lite whipped topping to reduce the calories. I couldn't taste the cream cheese (which is a good thing), but it provided an interesting texture and stability. I liked that it held shape after I served the first spoonful, so it didn't turn into runny mess. For those who said the pudding came out runny, it might be because you didn't whip it long enough (I whipped it in my blender for 2-3 minutes). If you like a good banana pudding, seriously, give this a try. It's almost as good after 5 days in the fridge as it was the first day. Don't be intimidated by the ingredients; it is quick to throw together and relatively mess-free!"
"1","5","Very good. I didn't do what the other reviewers said: Beat the room-temperature cream cheese thoroughly, and next time will to get rid of the little cream cheese bits. I'll beat that for 4 minutes or so. Otherwise, I did it by the book, though in the end I put a bit of caramel sauce on the top and surrounded that by Nilla wafers. Family loved it!"
"1","5","This is my go to recipe. I've made it with F/F sweetened condensed milk, 1% milk, Lite cool whip and it always turns out great. For those who have had soupy pudding I can only wonder if you used the right size box of instant pudding or if you used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk, which are not the same thing This is a fool proof recipe if you follow directions."
"1","5","I have made this at least 5 time, haven't change a thing, its easy and very good. Today I will add some fresh strawberry to it. Well see?? OMG"
"1","4","The end result was great, but the recipe is FAR from perfect as is. None of the amounts of each ingredient are good. I had to cut back the condensed milk, add extra pudding, and barely lucked out by not having RUNNY pudding. If I hadn't used extra pudding mix, then it would have been a disaster. Do Not strictly follow this recipe"
"1","4","Really very good! Make a lot. If I make it again, I will do the preparation a little differently. When I added the pudding mix it kind of congealed up into some small lumps that I could not get out. We still ate it!"
"1","4","Very very sweet. Following other reviewers, I used 1/2 can of condensed milk. I also made this with 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 banana instant pudding (5 oz total) per another reviewer. Next time I think I will follow instructions and just use vanilla instant pudding. Be sure cream cheese is room temp and very soft before mixing."
"1","5","just awesome-thank you for the recipe ;-)"
"1","5","Fantastic, huge hit every time I make it"
"1","5","1st time to make this & it was a big hit. Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe as is. Thanks :)"
"1","5","i followed the recipe to the t. i didn't find it to be to sweet . because there is so much pudding i did do two layers of wafers and bananas . the only thing i didn't do was add the remaining wiped topping i left that optional for the person eating . so i lined the pan with wafers and bananas and then pudding and then just repeated ."
"1","5","Very good and hit the dessert spot. I had a squeeze bottle of simple syrup and once in place, I gave those cookies a healthy quirt before I put in the filling. That turned out to be a great idea, the cookies were sweet and softened, but not mushy. This concoction was well received by all."
"1","5","This stuff is great, just used non fat milk, large pack of instant pudding and my own not so sweet whipping cream!"
"1","5","Made as per recipe. Family loved it! Thanks!"
"1","5","Made as directed. Excellent!!!!"
"1","5","Everyone ALWAYS asks for the recipe. It's the only way I will make it now."
"1","5","This was by far the BEST!!!banana pudding I've ever made, served, or eaten!!!!"
"1","5","This is a staple holiday dish. It's super simple to make, and taste like the good-old fashioned stuff. Just go straight by the recipe, it really doesn't need any kind of modification."
"1","5","Followed recipe all the way. After placing it in the break room for at the most an hour I came back to a empty dish. I was asked the recipe and to make it more often. Totally recommend the recipe to anyone. Very easy to make and was very satisfied with the outcome."
"1","5","The only thing I did t do was add the whip but this recipe was still a hit in my house. Has never made banana pudding before and this made it easy and enjoyable!"
"1","5","I do this just a little differently. I go the dollar store and get two cheap bags of vanilla wafers. They are more firm and will soften just a bit with the pudding mixture on top of it even if it sits overnight. The vanilla wafers aren't mushy and it makes for a better banana pudding. Also, I grind up some of the vanilla wafers and sprinkle them on top of the whipped topping. It makes a beautiful and tasty layer as well. This is always a huge hit at our house and family will beg me to make it every summer."
"1","5","My husband said this is the absolute best banana pudding he has ever eaten. He loves it! I have already made it for him two more times. I made it just as directed except I made my own whipped cream from scratch. I think it would probably taste great even if you use store bought. I only did this because I had a little extra time and had never made homemade whipped cream and wanted to try it (delicious by the way). Great recipe! Thanks!"
"1","5","I made this recipe as it is printed and it was fabulous! I can honestly say this is hands down, the BEST banana pudding I've ever eaten. My husband is very picky about his banana pudding and he practically swooned over this one! I thought about using banana cream pudding but I'm glad I didn't, it was wonderful as it is!"
"1","5","I followed most of the directions except for the cool whip (which I think is gross) which I substituted for real whipped cream and it turned out great! This was exactly how I remember Mom's."
"1","5","I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. My family loves when i make it."
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly and this banana pudding was okay. My family thought there was too much whipped topping."
"1","5","AWESOME!!!! My whole family LOVED this! Mine came out perfect! This will be my go to recipe for banana pudding for sure!"
"1","5","I read through the reviews and decided not to make any changes to the recipe. I'm glad I didn't because it turned out wonderful! Very tasty! There was a time that I thought it would end up being a soupy mess but was already starting to harden up by the time I added the whip cream. I refrigerated it over night and it was perfect by morning. Thanks for the great recipe!"
"1","5","Turned out great. Used 1 box of vanilla pudding 3.5 oz and was still fine. Hubby loved it was a great peacemaker after fight!"
"1","4","I absolutely loved this recipe! I had to mak a few changes. Direction states add 5 oz of vanilla pudding but the Commisary in va only have 1.5oz boxes. I added 3 boxes of pudding and added 2 extra cups of milk. Perfect!"
"1","5","This dessert was SO good! The family couldn't get enough. It's not a traditional banana pudding, but I liked it better, fluffy and creamy! I followed the recipe, except that I used more whipped cream than called for (in the recipe I used probly 3/4 of a tub and on top a whole tub). It set up perfectly, easy to slice and didn't fall apart! Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe! :)"
"1","5","This banana pudding was AMAZING! I didnt change anything except for putting less nilla cookies, 2 bananas and 2 1/2 cups of milk only because i thought it would get watery and the pan that i had was too small to put the batter in. it was fantastic!!! Delicious amd rich. Mm mmm mmmmm"
"1","5","Very easy to make!"
"1","5","Easy and delicious. I'm always asked for the recipe. I usually put this in a trifle dish or something where the layers and colours can be shown. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Heavenly fluff!!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written. If a recipe can come out this good without changing a single thing, it definitely deserves 5 stars!   Like WOODANGELA said in the most helpful positive review, make sure to use cream cheese at room temperature, blend really well and have your milk COLD when adding it. The result is the fluffy bliss texture of the pudding that makes you feel like you're consuming heavenly fluff.   This will be my go-to recipe for banana pudding from now on! Mom, Dad, and kid-approved! I have never had better tasting banana pudding and am proud to say I made it myself :)"
"1","5","It didn't last long in my house. :)"
"1","5","I've been making this recipe for years...but have just recently substituted Pecan Sandies instead of Nilla Wafers. I break them up into bite-size pieces, then put in bottom of pan (just as you would the wafers). I have to tell you, folks seem to like the pecan sandies much better than the wafers."
"1","5","I doubled this, but did not double the condendsed milk or the wipped topping and everyone loves it."
"1","5","I LOOOOOVED this and so did everyone at my party. I mean, loved so much they were licking the bowl (not only their bowl but the actual serving dish as well). It was a real hit WITH MODIFICATIONS! You have to only use 1/2 the condensed milk. I cannot even imagine how gross it would be with the full can. It was even slightly too sweet with half. I'd add *just* under half next time. I only used about 2.25 cups of skim milk instead of the full amount since I read a number of reviews saying it turned into a watery mess. Anyway, it was absolutely delicious. WILL make again. People who aren't even huge fans of banana pudding said they loved it because it wasn't that 'gross, too sweet' banana pudding they usually have."
"1","5","This was super easy (not sure how anyone can fudge this up). I followed the recipe exactly with beautiful results. My whole family enjoyed this very much. I am sure I'll be making this again."
"1","5","Everyone loved it!"
"1","5","I made this for 4th of July. Everyone loved it!!!"
"1","3","I am only giving this three stars based on the instructions not the flavor. I followed the instructions given and was sorry I did. Having never made this recipe before I was hoping for a more presentable end product. It was impossible for me to get the whipped topping to fold in correctly. I had to use my mixer to get it incorporated. I lined my dish with the cookies and bananas and then poured the mix on top. WHAT A MISTAKE! Cookies and bananas floated up everywhere. Needless to say at this point I did not even bother to try spreading the remaining topping on the soupy mix. I will make this again but will let the mixture set up for an hour or so before trying to fold in the topping and then will let it set up again before putting this on top of the cookies and bananas and then again before putting the topping over the top. Poorly written instructions so beware."
"1","5","Made for my family reunion and it was a hit. Made exactly as the recipe was written. Used Fruit Fresh for bananas which worked very well - after two days there was no browning or sliminess. Pudding was fluffy light yet really rich. Wish it didn't make so much as there are only two of us and we really feel we need to eat it all . Has been added to my tried and true kitchen recipe box. Thanks for sharing."
"1","5","Made this exactly as written! Everyone loved it! This is my new go to recipe. It was quick and easy to throw together and oh so yummy!"
"1","5","Great Recipe, At first the mixture came out a little too thin due to my own error. I stirred the cool whip instead of folding it. But to fix that I just heated the mixture up on the stove until thickened. I chilled it until completely cool and topped it off with the whipped topping and wafers. Delicious!"
"1","5","BOMB! Used layer of nilla waffers on top & covered with whipped cream. We tried it about an hour after I made it and could taste the swt condensed milk a little too much. The waffers were too crunchy too. After letting it sit about 24 hrs it was the best banana pudding any of us have ever had. Will never use any other recipe."
"1","5","Okay, this recipe is easy and so delish! My whole family loved it, to include my son who is a picky eater. The only thing I changed was instead of 3 cups of milk I just added 2. But everything else I included.... best banana pudding ever!!!"
"1","5","I made this for a church potluck, and it went so fast I didn't even get any! All I got was a constant stream of 'can I get the recipe?'! I've made it a few times since, following the recipe exactly as it reads, and wow, it is yummy. I love that it doesn't have that fake banana taste, since it uses vanilla pudding instead of artificially-flavored banana pudding."
"1","5","I have been using this recipe for about a year and every time I make it people can't get enough. I usually have to triple the recipe. The best recipe!!"
"1","4","Pretty good, skipped sweetened condensed milk"
"1","5","I made this for the first time 8/11/12, and realized I never rated it. I absolutely love this recipe; it is my favorite dessert. I'm making this for Valentines Day today. If you haven't tried it, you should! We call it 'Banilla' in our house ... Banilla says it all!"
"1","4","It was a good recipe but too sweet for my taste. I might cut out the condensed milk next time."
"1","5","For the person who said that their recipe would never set up, I was wondering if you tried to use the 'low fat' cream cheese? My mother-in-law and I have made this recipe exactly several times and it turned out delicious, she and I both have tried the 'low fat' substitutions in it and other things and a runny mess is always the result. I never use the low fat cream cheese or condensed milk anymore. Also, if you like the real homemade flavor of this, do not substitute a box of banana flavored pudding. Unless you like for your homemade recipes to taste like store bought plastic. I don't understand why you would put real bananas in this and then use artificial banana flavoring too. It gives this a heavy, waxy, and weird flavor if you do."
"1","5","I followed recipe exactly...it was the best banana pudding i have ever tasted!"
"1","5","So delicious! Followed recipe exactly and it turned out great!"
"1","5","This was great and definitely a crowd pleaser. It makes A LOT as well. I did it pretty much exactly as the recipe says and it came out wonderful. DO be sure to get the 5 oz pkg of pudding and that it says INSTANT. The boxes look nearly identical. I can see it turning out soupy if you accidentally buy the 'cook and serve' version."
"1","4","This would get 10 stars with the modifications I made,( in my opinion). I only used 2 1/2 cups of milk and about 3 oz (2 small boxes)of banana cream instant pudding. I also used the whole bag of vanilla wafers. I layered it in a round casserole glass dish (cookies, pudding mix, cookies, pudding mix, and cool whip on top. I also omitted the bananas, I don't like chunks of banana, just the flavor. Very easy to put together."
"1","5","Love this recipe .. added layer of sliced strawberries on sliced bananas.. used 1/2 & 1/2.. gives ice cream flavor ..and fat ...then topped off with grated chocolate .. Banana Split Dessert .. Thanks for recipe! requested often : )."
"1","5","To die for!!!"
"1","3","this is a little too sweet it is very creamy but the more you eat it becomes very rich"
"1","4","i like this alot but the boys weren't crazy for it. which unfortunately means i likely won't make it again :( it's a great summer dessert with a light taste. i subbed the vanilla pudding for lemon and thought that was nice change."
"1","4","This is a great recipe, however, i modified to delete using milk or condensed milk alltogether...to sweeten the recipe try a jar of marshmallow creme plus the cool whip and mix with the other ingredients(pudding mix..wafers, bannanas, etc)...it makes the pudding thick and creamy, without the risk of being runny if it isnt going to be gobbled up in an hour...YUM!!!"
"1","4","I followed the recipe exactly and the adults in my family loved it. I'll definitely make it again, however, I thought it was pretty rich, I guess it was the condensed milk. The kids said it was almost too sugary, made them a little sick. I'll still make it again since it's so good, but I might try it with a little less condensed milk."
"1","5","All I can say is 'WOW! This was so good. The pudding was awesome by itself, but with the bananas and wafers, this dessert was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","My entire family has voted this recipe the BEST banana pudding they have ever eaten. Two of them don't even like bananas! I followed the directions exactly as written. Give it plenty of time to chill in the refridgerator before serving."
"1","5","Made this for our 4th of July BBQ and everyone loved it. I only had half a tub of cool whip so I folded it in to the pudding mix and put extra cookies on top instead of the cool whip. So good!"
"1","5","i made this and did make a few changes, i didnt add cream cheese (i forgot to put it in and it was sitting on counter in front of me) i used a small box of both the vanilla and banana pudding, 2 cups milk, and instead of cool whip (i dont like the after taste) i used a little more than 8oz of heavy whipping cream with a little less than half a can of condensed milk, whipped the condensed milk vanilla and cream together and mixed the pudding and milk and then folded the pudding into the whipped cream and before i ate it threw some banana and vanilla wafers on top, this is by far my new favorite recipe and am thinking about filling a cupcake with it. light and fluffy not too sweet and isnt runny. i will be making this again!"
"1","5","Love it"
"1","5","Everyone loved it."
"1","5","This was fantastic! Follow the recipe exactly to get the best banana pudding you've ever tasted. YUM! I did use Mexican vanilla as I feel it tastes much better than typical brands at the grocery store."
"1","5","Made this dish for Memorial Day! It was an absolute hit, everyone LOVED it. I will definitely make this again!!"
"1","5","I mistakenly bought a 3.5 ounce vanilla pudding so I used 6 ounces cream cheese, a little over 3/4 cup of condensed milk, and 2 1/4 cups very cold milk. I only used 2 bananas one of which I sliced very thin and placed over the bottom layer of nilla wafers. I put half of the pudding mixture then I mixed mashed banana with the remaining whipped cream and spread that over the pudding. Then I added more nilla wafers around the glass and spread the remaining pudding over the top. Perfecto!"
"1","5","This may be the only banana pudding recipe that is as good as my Mimi's. I brought this to a small group meeting, and they devoured it!"
"1","5","I've made this for almost every barbeque I've attended this year. Everyone begs for the recipe and I've had multiple repeat requests for 'next time!' It's easy to make and holds up well (even with generic ingredients!). Great recipe! It's definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","My family just raves over this version of Banana Pudding. It is a staple at the Holiday Table. Yummy!"
"1","5","I followed the recipe as written and it was delish. It was a little runny, but I think that it was because I used store brand sweetened condensed milk. I have noticed that store brand is always runnier than 'real' (for lack of a better word) brand. Will make again!!!"
"1","4","This is close to the way I also make it but I, like other reviewers use the Cheesemen cookies. I also prefer 1/2 french vanilla and 1/2 cheesecake instant pudding, with a pinch of nutmeg and allspice, and I use quartered strawberries to garnish the top. Like other reviewers mentioned... NO LEFTOVERS! Just made it for my brother for his birthday by his request, he thought he would be kind and share with other family members - he was upset he only got 2 squares! LOL! Great recipe!"
"1","5","We loved this! I'm positive it is perfect as is, but I did make adjustments to lower the fat and calories. I did low fat whipped topping, reduced condensed milk, and lower far cream cheese. It tastes even better the second day!"
"1","5","Made exactly as recipe stated. Yummy!"
"1","5","WOW Better than I ever expected for a non cook banana pudding!!!!"
"1","5","This is absolutely delicious. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of cinnamon. I had a lot of trouble getting the lumps out with a hand mixer, I assume if I had a better mixer it would have been fine. I just ate it with the lumps because I gave up."
"1","2","2 stars because it is traditional."
"1","5","This was delicious! I let the cream cheese get room temp before creaming in a Kitchenaid mixer. Moreover, I used a 50/50 of whole milk and 1% milk because that's all I had in the refrigerator. Other than that, I followed this recipe to a 'T' and it was perfect. It reminds me of a banana pudding I used to get in a BBQ restaurant in Navarre Florida, so thanks for bringing back those wonderful memories. Thank you so much for the recipe."
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe! I tried it out on my husband and father-in-law back in January (2012) and they loved it."
"1","5","Made this recipe twice and BOTH times it was a hit! 1st time came home with a CLEAN dish and 2nd barely had one serving left. Even folks who claim they don't like banana pudding enjoyed it. I am VERY GLAD I read reviews first as I used only 1/2 can of sweetened condenced milk and it was plenty sweet!! YUM-YUM!! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"1","5","This was so good!"
"1","5","My family said this was the best banana pudding they had ever had! & it was :)"
"1","5","Literally the BEST banana pudding I have ever had."
"1","5","Amazing recipe! This will be my go to banana pudding recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","This was amazing. Didn't make any changes."
"1","5","Excellent. Just the way my grandma use to make it."
"1","5","This pudding was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I made as directed except I added 2 more bananas. I couldn't imagine changing anything else. Make sure your cream cheese is at room temperature. Thank you so much for this recipe!"
"1","5","I made this Banana Pudding as written, EXCEPT I used a whole box of the Mini Nilla Wafers (I really don't see how 1/2 a box of regular Nilla Wafers could be anywhere near enough cookies...). I used all 3 cups of milk, and I also used the whole can of condensed milk. I didn't think it was too sweet, and it the chilled end-result had a great consistency. I used 5 bananas -- but they were smaller. Loved it!"
"1","4","This was very well received at a family get together. People commented 'this is not your average banana pudding'. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because I personally didn't care for it, and it won't be in my regular recipe rotation unless requested."
"1","5","Took advice of users and only used about 1/2 to 2/3 can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 1/2 cups milk. Huge hit from picky people! Thanks for a great recipe."
"1","5","YUM YUM YUM!!! Wouldn't change a thing, fantastic thanks for sharing! ps: I added some chop pecans for a topping and that extra crunch."
"1","5","FAMILY FAVORITE! THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH!"
"1","5","I've made this per the recipe and it was fantastic. I also made it using all low fat ingredients and it was still amazing. Great recipe, you can't mess it up!"
"1","5","Very Good! Light and not to rich or sweet. Easy to make."
"1","5","Made this as written, it was wonderful! I can't wait to serve this to my family and friends"
"1","2","How can this be rated so high? It seriously tastes all like the sweetened condensed milk- and I made it just as the recipe says! Though it tasted good and everyone ate their full portions, we all found it lacking. Will NOT be trying this one again!"
"1","5","Make this often my family loves it. THANKS for sharing this great recipe."
"1","5","so yummy! I accidentally used the whole box of cookies (mis-read), but was still so delicious!"
"1","5","Easy and Good. Great for get togethers."
"1","5","this is the best"
"1","5","It was a hit at the firehouse! Great and EASY dessert!"
"1","5","I made a few different banana pudding recipes and tested them out on my family. This is the one that got rave reviews. I dont like bananas so I had just the pudding and wafers and it was so nice, fluffy, and smooth. Everyone said it had a great banana taste to it and they loved it."
"1","5","This was by far the best banana pudding recipe. It was amazing! I wouldn't change a thing!"
"1","5","Great recipe, was gone as soon as it was put out!"
"1","5","Sooooooooooo good. Nothing else to say !"
"1","5","Thanks Patty awesome recipe! Followed exactly as written and viola, my family loves it! Kuddos to you!"
"1","4","I tried with less milk and condensed milk, but it wasn't creamy enough and less sweet than I hoped."
"1","5","All I can say is OMG Soo Good. This was my first time actually making banana pudding (tho I have had it a million times) & it was so good & easy. As per my 15 yr old 'mmm Mommy this is def a keeper.' :)"
"1","5","My family loves this banana pudding recipe with chess cookies instead on vanilla wafers. Yummy!"
"1","5","at the risk of granny turning in her grave....gotta say that I've come over to the 'dark side'...NEVER would have thought I'd find a no-bake version as good as my grandma's classic baked banana pudding. My hat is off to you Patty...this was FABULOUS :)"
"1","5","Easy, and absolutely WONDERFUL!"
"1","5","Followed the recipe exactly and it came out fabulous! I personally don't like banana pudding but my family, who is mostly Nigerian, adores it so I made it for my father-in-law while he visited and he loved it."
"1","4","Pretty good recipe - I liked it. But, the 'filling' thickens up pretty quickly, so I would suggest getting the vanila wafers and bananas ready before you add the instant vanilla pudding mix, so it is pretty liquid when you pour it over the bananas and wafers, so it will sprad out more evenly."
"1","5","Recipe was super tasty. Used lots of extra cookies and bananas. The was my grandma used to make it. Thanks for the flavor memories."
"1","5","Really really good! Took it to a 4th of July party and it was loved! Very rich."
"1","5","Great pudding, everyone loved it."
"1","5","Absolutely the best I've ever eaten! Even my 74 year old southern Dad, thinks it is the best he has ever eaten. And he loooovvves him some banana pudding."
"1","5","I made this last week for an office party-was a hit and not a crumb left! So glad I found this site and the recipe! Making it for 4th of July party today! WONDERFUL! I did double the bananas."
"1","5","This is right up there with Paula Deen's banana pudding - simply decadent, yummy and pretty easy to make. Stop looking - you've found an amazing pudding!"
"1","5","5 stars and I made it for 50. I mixed everything but 10 cups of milk and cool whip in my stand mixer then put in stock pot due to large batter! Also just used 4 boxes of pudding, 4 cans of milk and 4 less bananas. I added one extra cool whip so each of the 4 containers could have their own cool whip and an extra box of wafers! It made 4 aluminum double layer pans! I loved the ease of making it and that it didn't have eggs!"
"1","5","This was one of the easiest desserts I have made. Presented in a trifle bowl with Pepperidge Farm Chessmen on the bottom and facing out along the side, two layers of pudding/bananas. Beautiful visually and wonderful to eat!!"
"1","5","I have made this recipe for all different groups of people and occasions and each time I am asked to make it again and again and again. Everyone absolutely loves it. I give it as gifts for christmas and its a staple at my office's potlucks."
"1","5","This is delicious! It is certainly not like cooked banana pudding, but I like it better! I would like to try it with homemade pudding and real whipped cream one day, but the shortcuts still taste great."
"1","5","Yummy! I also used about the can of sweetened milk so it wouldn't be too runny. Will definitely make this again because I loved what the cream cheese did for this pudding."
"1","5","To die for!! I like my tasty treats dense so I only used 2 cups cold milk and turned out perfect!"
"1","3","I followed the recipe exactly as it is here, and although the pudding came out good it wasn't as I expected based on the other reviews. It came out way too sweet with the whole can of the sweetened condensed milk. Next time maybe I'll just use half."
"1","5","This is the most amazing summer dessert. The only modification I made was 1 cup of crushed Chessmen on top."
"1","5","Very easy and very good! This is the perfect recipe for kids to make themselves. My 9-yr old son was very proud of it and his cooking efforts were encouraged even more by our rave reviews. He made half the recipe in a 9in glass pie pan."
"1","3","Was good and a nice change from the traditional banana pudding but next time I will reduce the cream cheese and/or use banana pudding. The banana flavor got lost in the cream cheese. Sounds odd but it was rich at the same time as being a bit bland! Weird I know but think less cream cheese and more banana would be better. Thanks!"
"1","5","I made this last night. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so delicious!"
"1","5","The BEST banana pudding recipe ever! It was so good, I ate it for breakfast some mornings ;) Make it..you'll love it!"
"1","5","Very good and pretty easy to make."
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding. No changes needed. Superb. I love to top with 3-4 fresh strawberries as a garnish. So simple, so delicious."
"1","5","Dee-licious. Very creamy. I would probably substitute the cool whip with fresh whipped cream to make it extra delicious."
"1","4","I will make this again but next time I want to do the following: 1. No cookies on bottom - they were just soggy and pointless. Kids didn't want to eat them. 2. Line bottom with bananas only. 3. Put cookie crumbs & full cookies on top of pudding......right before I serve so that there is still a crunch."
"1","5","probably the best banana pudding i have ever had. very sweet! followed recipe/instructions exactly but next time i will add more wafers and bananas for personal preference. great recipe, thank you!"
"1","5","Best banana pudding I've ever had. My family absolutely loved it. I've made it twice now, and it's a hit!"
"1","5","This is always a huge hit with my guys. I use banana cream pudding mix instead of vanilla."
"1","5","great banana pudding my 17 yr old daughter makes this and it so goood !!!!"
"1","5","This was soooo good. I made it one night to use up some bananas, and my kids begged for more. My sister-in-law was staying with us, and she has asked me to make it everytime she has come over. The only thing I did different was I didn't spread the cool whip over the top because some of my kids don't like it. I just added a dallop to individual servings. YUMMY!"
"1","5","yummy. followed recipe exactly, turned out great. very, very good"
"1","5","Delicious! I used everything just like it said, but I didn't actually count the nilla wafers. I just did nice layers however it seemed right. I did use fat free sweetened condensed milk and reduced fat nilla wafers. It was absolutely delicious! It was sweet, but not too sweet (I did use the whole can). I couldn't stop licking the spoon!! The only negative I have is that even after leaving the cream cheese out for about 3 hours, it still got lumpy. That could be my fault though, attempting to cream it with my Kitchen Aid in stead of by hand. I put it through a strainer and it was much less lumpy."
"1","5","BEST FREAKING DESSERT EVER!!!!! I loved this recipe! I recommend using the Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies for sure! This was such a hit at my Christmas Party! This is something I will make every year from now on!"
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding! It's so rich and creamy! This is now a family favorite."
"1","5","Every time I make this several people say it is the BEST banana pudding they have ever had. My husbands coworkers request it for every office party! It is AWESOME!"
"1","5","This was much better the 2nd day!! Everyone loved it!! I will be making this again for Christmas! Also, I only used 2 cups milk and the consistency was perfect. I've read a few reviews that state theirs did not form or it was too soupy/runny. I do think 3 cups milk is a bit too much. That was the only change I made."
"1","5","Easy banana pudding recipe. Very rich and creamy but not too heavy or sweet. I used a trifle bowl and bite-sized vanilla wafers and it whipped up easily and beautifully."
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding I ever had. Everyone loves it, when we have potluck at work everyone ask for this pudding!!!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe , Ive made this every year for two years on thanksgiving, a big hit with my family and friends..."
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding recipe I have tried. I have to make two for Thanksgiving - one for the VFW and one for the family. I've become very popular since introducing it to friends and famiy. Definitely 5 stars"
"1","5","I made this recipe and loved it. I only used 2c. of milk and turned out great. I will make this more often in the future. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
"1","5","I am a southern girl from Alabama and I am so picky about banana pudding, this was great! I hate making pudding from scratch b/c it seems like you are at the stove whisking forever to get the right consistency. This is an easy, no fuss recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
"1","5","Very good recipe! Banana pudding is pretty nostalgic for me, and this is a really great recipe for it! My brother is diabetic, and I've also made a diabetic version using some sugar-free shortbread cookies (closest cookie I could find), sugar-free pudding, sugar-free whipped cream, and a diabetic substitute for sweetened condensed milk that I found online. It turned out delicious as well."
"1","5","This is a wonderful recipe! My boyfriend and I really liked it, and so did everyone at work. It was the first time I had made it and it turned out perfect. I will use this recipe many times over."
"1","4","The pudding came out a little less set than I would have liked, so the second time around I used less milk and it was perfect. Great recipe!"
"1","5","I made this banana pudding last night for my husband who loves banana pudding more than any dessert. It turned out to be the best banana pudding either one of us has ever tried. I did use 2 packages of instant pudding mix, 5 bananas, 12 ounce of cream cheese, 16 ounce of Nilla waffers."
"1","5","OMG...This is amazing considering how easy it is to make..I love the fact that it is a NO BAKE recipe...easy for kids to help out...oh and it is delicious. Made it for my southern belle mom last week and she hid the left overs from my father...it tastes even better the second day! WOW. no more standing over a double boiler to make banana pudding..yEEhaw!"
"1","5","Best recipe for Banana Pudding hands down! Of course there are SMALL ways to tweak it, but everytime I make it or pass on this recipe it becomes someone elses go to desert (especially around holidays which is really saying something)!! Even if someone doesn't like bananas this recipe Never disapoints!"
"1","4","This was good, but nothing to write home to mom about. I gave it 4 stars because my husband liked it and he doesnt like banana pudding"
"1","5","Very rich but yet awesome!"
"1","5","Awww, My cousin's girlfriend made this Banana Pudding for me in Las Vegas this summer using the identified ingredients only using Pepperidge Farm's Chessmen Butter cookies in leiu of Wafers. Geez! when she took it out the refridge after several hours of sitting, she cut it into squares and it was a neatly cut square at that. I ate the of my piece and wanted more but it was very rich, but yet delish!!!!!! Thanks for the creator who invented this Mean Nana Pudding this way!!!!! I made it, and of course it took me near 2 weeks to eat it all and still ended up throwing some out. I love this recipe so much! ***Will bring this to all Family gatherings, date nites, and make it for my upcoming birthday!!!!!"
"1","5","My family loves this recipe! I usually just use two bananas, but other than that follow the recipe as is and it is great. It is quite rich so beware of that, but this is my favorite Banana Pudding recipe I have tried."
"1","5","For a large party, I doubled the recipe and used a large trifle bowl, creating a checkerboard pattern of wafers and banana slices. I used the box of french vanilla and half a box of banana pudding and a little extra whipped topping. I also reduced milk to 2 cups as suggested by many. It was awesome! I overheard guests saying that it was the best banana pudding they had ever had"
"1","5","YUMMY!!! This was the best banana pudding that you don't have to slave over! I do like pudding from scratch but this is the next best thing!"
"1","5","I did not change anything and followed the recipe as directed, it turned out perfectly! I did dip my bananas in lemon juice to keep from browning, but the lemon juice wasn't tasted at all."
"1","5","I made this pudding exactly as recipe said. Brought it over to a bbq and people loved it! THANKS"
"1","5","OMG this desset is serious! I followed the directions exactly as written. I let it set for a few hours in the fridge and the pudding gets so thick and rich TDF!!"
"1","5","This is the only Banana Pudding recipe I will ever use again. It was wonderful and so easy to fix. Took it to work and it was a big hit."
"1","3","good flavor but my cream cheese wasn't room temp so the texture was lumpy and off. i would have preferred more of a banana flavor."
"1","5","Oh my, this is YUMMY! Only thing I did different was two small vanilla puddings and 2 1/2 cups of milk. Absolutely scrumptious!!!"
"1","4","I went by some of the other users opinions and made some changes. I used skim milk, and only used 2 and a half cups because i didnt want it to be runny. It turned out really good but i would make some changes if i made it again. Id use at least 3 cups milk because it was a little too thick. Id also use less condensed milk because it is really sweet. And lastly id use one or two more bananas!"
"1","5","i made this with weight watchers cream cheese, non fat condensed milk and 1% milk....still the best banana pudding ever! my family ate a whole pan in one day and asked me to make another. it really brings out the greedy in a person."
"1","5","Hands down....the best banana pudding recipe I've ever tried."
"1","4","This is a really good recipe. However, I made it using french vanilla instant pudding and it was so much better to me!"
"1","5","Very good and rich. I would add a little bit more whipped topping to cut the richness but that's a personal preference. Recipe is delish as stands! Thanks"
"1","4","Very good. I topped mine with crushed wafers."
"1","5","I used this Banana Pudding recipe over the 4th of July Weekend and everyone LOVED it! Most recipes only consist of vanilla pudding and bananas, but this recipe is so rich and has so much flavor! I followed other reviews and used only 2 cups of cold milk to keep the pudding thick. It turned out DELISH :)"
"1","5","The recipe was good, but it wasn't like the banana pudding I'm used to. I will keep this recipe and spread the pudding mix on a graham cracker shell. Thanks!"
"1","5","Excellent! I made this for a potluck yesterday and this morning I was hunted down by five people from another department asking for leftovers and the recipe. I had to tell them that it was devoured during the potluck and promise to bring another one in on Monday. Also made a batch for my home and my husband and daughters ate it in one sitting. This recipe is decadent yet delicate and tastes great! Thank you for the recipe. it is now a member of the family."
"1","5","I thought I had eaten some good banana pudding before, but I was WRONG! I absolutely couldn't believe how awesome this recipe is, and you don't even use banana pudding! I suggest waiting to it this until after it has set in the fridge overnight. I tried it after it was in the fridge for four hours and it wasn't cold enough and the flavors weren't mixed together as well. It is definitely worth the wait!!"
"1","5","This is a cool, easy summer dessert well-liked by the entire family. Any sweetened condensed milk aftertaste will fade as the flavors have a chance to blend, so allow enough time for the pudding to rest in the fridge. Even a few hours helps. We like using Chessmen instead of vanilla wafers just fine, but lately we've been using coconut cookies for a really tropical, summery treat."
"1","5","I have been making this recipe for about 4 years now, and it has been DEMANDED at Thanksgiving and Christmas every year since the first time I made it. I had to make two this year just to make sure there was some left for me! The best banana pudding I have ever had, and my entire family agrees!! :)"
"1","3","pretty rich for banana`pudding. i'd use all low fat ingredients next time."
"1","4","Kids loved it, adults thought it was too sweet. I would definitely cut down on the condensed milk next time and maybe add banana cream pudding mix in like some other reviewers suggested. Overall it's a very rich, creamy dessert that you can fix up in minutes!"
"1","5","A bit rich ,but WONDERFUL! Yummy!!!"
"1","5","I've always love banana pudding made the old fashion way on top of the stove...until I made this one for myself as written...I will not make the other one again. This is amazing to me I love BP and my family loved it. Thank you for sharing."
"1","3","It's easy to make and convenient. However, you need to let it sit in the fridge for a day or two so the flavors meld together. My husband and I ate some about four hours after I had made it and the prepackaged box taste of the Nilla wafers was very detectable."
"1","5","Seriously Good! You don't have to change a thing about this recipe. I thought at first it was going to be way to sweet, but once it settles and mingles with your bananas and wafers, it's really the best banana pudding you will ever eat. In fact, I made this recipe and put them in small clear cups as individual desserts for a luncheon at work. People literally thought the catering place brought them in. Until one of my friends spoke up and said, Um Jess made these, not the BBQ joint. Will make again!"
"1","5","So easy and so good. Everyone loved it and it was really easy to make. Took very little time and a great make ahead dessert."
"1","5","Everyone in my house who ate this said it was the best pudding they have ever had, myself included. It is very creamy and rich, lots of flavor and the wafter crust is perfect."
"1","5","Every time I make this everyone loves it!"
"1","5","I don't remember if I followed this recipe or Paula Deen's but I used both when making and it came out DELICIOUS!"
"1","5","This was fantastic! I used light Cool Whip and light cream cheese to make it a tad bit 'healthier.' It was so creamy and rich..will DEFINITELY be making this again!"
"1","5","Very good and very creamy. My whole family loved it! Going to make again."
"1","5","This was delicious and my boyfriend loved it! It made a lot of pudding so I layered it (2 layers). The pudding was very runny even after putting in the whipped topping so I stuck it in the fridge for about a half hour and it thickened right up. Great recipie, will definitely use again!"
"1","5","Fabulous!"
"1","5","I gave this review 5 stars even though I have made it twice and both times it was more like soup. We still really enjoyed it. I called it Banana Pudding Soup. I have no clue about what I am doing wrong but I do know that I am going to keep trying until I get it right.  Well I finally got it right and it was the best banana pudding ever. I have never made instant pudding. For some reason I was using the bread dough attachment instead of the whisk. Once I came to my senses and used the whisk it was perfect and enjoyed by all."
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding ever!!"
"1","1","I used the sugar free vanilla instant pudding and it turned out like soup. Extremely runny! I don't think its the pudding's fault. Too much milk?? I would say it was unedible but the husband just smiled and ate it anyway. He is a keeper, this recipe is not. Sorry."
"1","5","this was exceptional! i used sugar free pudding mix and the light whipped toppingas im reducing my familys sugar intake. i also used less vanilla wafers. i chilled this for 2 hours. they didnt miss the cookies or the sugar in this. i will make this again!"
"1","5","This pudding recipe should be a crime. It's THAT GOOD. (Next time, I'll be reducing to 2-2.5 cups of milk instead of 3. Never thickened for me.)"
"1","5","Work potluck - loved by all!"
"1","5","omg this is the best banana pudding we have ever tasted (had).thank you soooo much patty ,from now on this will be the only banana pudding ill make."
"1","5","Made this for a potluck at work and it recieved rave reviews. That was only last week and they are already asking when I will make it again. Followed the recipe as is. It was awesome!!"
"1","5","I have made this pudding so many times. It's better than my mom's! I make a couple of changes based on personal preference, but the recipe as written is fabulous! The only changes I make are adding 2 additional bananas, using almost a whole box of wafers, and reducing the condensed milk a bit. My mom always layered her pudding in a deep, glass bowl, so I do the same with this. I have made this with vanilla pudding, banana pudding, and a combination of the two. I enjoyed the combination the most. Some may not like the taste of the artificial banana pudding and it may not be traditional, but I think it's yummy with the added banana flavor."
"1","5","Very good. Easy to put together."
"1","5","Awesome recipe as is!"
"1","4","OMG this was such a hit! Mine didn't firm up quite enough so I may cut more of the liquid out next time (I used about 3/4 of the called for condensed milk and 2 1/2 cups of skim milk). I also added fresh strawberries. It wasn't the prettiest desert (probably since was kind of runny) but everyone wanted seconds. I will make this again for sure!"
"1","5","This is a great recipe and easy too. Made it for our family reunion this year and it was one of the first desserts gone. Nothing but rave reviews. Thanks!!!"
"1","5","Delicious! I made this for our Sunday night dinner. The family was all smiles, wondering why I made such a 'special' desert. Creamy and yummy were the words used to describe it. Thank you for making me always look so good."
"1","5","Delicious!! Made for my husband's fire station and they made him call me for the recipe!"
"1","5","This is just the banana pudding recipe I was looking for and it turned out great. Much sweeter than the instant version though so beware, I had people tell me they like the way I used to make the banana pudding before because of that. I used vanilla pudding and I really like ginger snaps so I used ginger snap cookies as my bottom layer, kind of like a crust and then crushed ginger snap cookies to sprinkle over the top which looked and tasted great. And I also had some ginger snap cookies on the side while eating my pudding cause like I said, I REALLY like ginger snaps!"
"1","5","OMG!!!n I am sitting here eating a bowl of this banana pudding right now and it is DELICIOUS!!! This is as close to 'BIG MAMA' recipe as it gets. I did however make just a few changes. I took the advise of other reviews and did 2, 3.4oz boxes of french vanilla pudding and instead of vanilla extract, I used banana extract. Besides that, I followed the recipe as written and am beyond happy the results. THANKS SO MUCH FOR AN AWESOME RECIPE:-)"
"1","5","This was a great hit. I did make it a double layer of waffers and bananas and next time I would make it the night before as it tasted better then next day but other then that perfect!"
"1","5","This recipe was awesome just as it is written - no alterations needed"
"1","5","This recipe is very good. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. Very nice flavor..tastes like you worked on it for hours not minutes."
"1","5","Excellent recipe and easy. Inlaws loved it!"
"1","5","My kids went crazy over this!!! It's a keeper"
"1","5","Delicious recipe! I made it as is and it was perfect"
"1","5","Delicious! I made this for a Christmas party and everyone was talking/asking about it. The longer you let it chill, the softer the cookies get, so that's personal taste as to how soft you want the cookies. I made this with two different families and everyone loved it. Super easy as well."
"1","5","This is just how I remember my grandmother making banana pudding. Although, I did a few things different. It turned out to be a hit."
"1","4","I am used to very sweet banana pudding and I thought the flavor of this was great and not too sweet! I really enjoy the cream cheese, too. I felt like it wasn't as thick as i'm used to. Like the pudding didn't set up very well. However the texture was great!"
"1","3","Well either my tastebuds were off or my expectations were set too high, but I thought this recipe tasted a little too 'instant' compared to memories of 100% homecooked banana pudding. I didn't really like the soggy vanilla wafer effect the day after either. The plus is it's very quick to prepare."
"1","5","I used to be obsessed with the banana pudding at a restaurant called Black Eyed Pea. This banana pudding tastes exactly like it. It is TO DIE FOR. I admit, I ate about half of it myself. The first night! An amazing amazing AMAZING dish! You can put it in a fancy serving bowl, and VOILA- dessert masterpiece."
"1","3","Very easy to make and great flavor. I wasn't wild about the texture, way too creamy and heavy for me."
"1","5","Its amazing. Best I've ever had. I've made it several times. Always a huge success!!"
"1","5","This was great. You could taste the whipped topping if you tried. I didn't put any on top of mine, just in the pudding itself. Light and fluffy, quick too."
"1","5","This was a HUGE hit at my Family Reunion this summer! My Favorite Aunt Judy made the famous version that involves cooked and more time consuming banana pudding but it didn't come close to this recipe. They practically licked the tin pan and asked if there was more back in my cabin. I smashed a ripe banana and added it to the pudding mixture and only used whipped cream on the top. It was so easy and delicious!"
"1","5","simply delicious!"
"1","5","I brought this to a potluck and all night overheard people say, 'Who made the banana pudding? It's great!'"
"1","5","absolutely delicous!!!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe. I am the manager of a foodservice operation and it is sooo good that I am using it in my facility."
"1","5","AWESOME! This is definitely the best banana pudding ever! I have made it twice in the last couple weeks and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. Definitely use about 3/4 of the condensed milk, I did and it turned out great!"
"1","5","The ultimate Banana Pudding recipe, no need to look further. This was one of my grandfather's favorite desserts and it has become one of my family's favorites as well. I used sugar free vanilla pudding this time to cut some of the sugar and it turned out great!"
"1","5","Growing up in the south, banana pudding is a must! This recipe is wonderful. I have made it many times and this last time I decided to try and make it a bit healthier. I used fat free condensed milk, fat free cool whip and reduced fat cream cheese. It was GREAT!. The only thing I do different is that I never use the full can of condensed milk. I usually use about 1/2 of it. Thanks for the recipe! It is a definite keeper!"
"1","5","Love loved this. Again…I stayed true to the recipe and it was fantastic. There wasn’t too much over powering banana taste and the pudding along with the combination of cream cheese and cool wip made it taste very smooth and decadent."
"1","5","super good... everyone at work party liked it... even the health food junkie that will never eat desserts ate it and went back for seconds!! will make again."
"1","3","I give this a 3 where my husband would give it a 5 as he loves banana's and I do not. It was definitely a good recipe though I must say. I used 1/3 the fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk, and fat free cool whip."
"1","5","Simply the BEST!"
"1","5","I have made this recipes numerous times-- and it is always a huge hit. I never have any leftovers to bring home when I take it to a party!"
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding ever!!! I make it just like the recipe says and everyone thinks its perfect. I made it for my mother in law who hates bananas and even she liked it. Everywhere I go, I am asked to bring this recipe. I make it over and over again."
"1","5","WOW WOW WOW!!!!!! THIS IS MY FIRST TIME MAKING BANANA PUDDING AND IT CAME OUT GREAT! I USED 1/3 LESS FAT CREAM CHEESE AND INSTEAD OF FROZEN WHIPPED CREAM I USED REDDI CANNED WHIPPED CREAM. NEXT TIME I'LL USE BANANA PUDDING MIX AND BANANA EXTRACT INSTEAD OF VANILLA. I'LL LET U GUYS KNOW HOW THAT ONE CAME OUT."
"1","4","*** I ALWAYS MAKE HOMEMADE, FROM SCRATCH, STAND OVER THE STOVER FOR HOURS PUDDING**** So, to use this recipe and like it says A LOT! I hardly ever follow a recipe. So sorry to those of you that hate that! I added about 4oz of Sour Cream. Used 2 - 3.4oz pgs of French Vanilla pudding ( all I had on hand, later doubled the recipe and used regular Vanilla) Added an entire tub of Cool Whip to that mixture. I think I acutally only used 2.5 cups of milk too. I would reccomend adding 3+ with the extra pudding I added. There was PLENTY using that recipe. Tasted VERY GOOD!"
"1","5","This was so good and everyone told me how great it was. I made this for a BBQ last weekend and it was gone! I was hoping to take a little home for later, but no luck. I followed the recipe to a T, but next time I will only use half of the sweet milk, I will use homemade whipped cream instead of the frozen whipped topping, and I will not put as much whipped cream on the top of the pudding."
"1","5","Great Recipe! My hubby loved it!"
"1","5","Delicious! I used light cream cheese, skim milk, & light cool whip and it still tasted very rich & creamy! I will definitely make this over & over!"
"1","5","Absolutely Scrumptious!!!"
"1","3","My 11 year old daughter made this. Hubby and daughter liked it. I did not care for it. I thought it was to rich and sweet."
"1","5","By far the best banana pudding recipe I have tried. I am a HUGE condensed milk fan so this brought just the right extra creamy rich flavor that standard recipes that only include pudding, bananas, wafers and cool whip lack. The cream cheese was a nice addition and i believe you dont even have to be a cream cheese fan to love this recipe! The flavor of the cream cheese was so mild. This recipe is a bit richer than standard banana pudding recipes so keep that in mind if you don't have much of a sweet tooth."
"1","5","This recipe is a great success with family and firends. I used all the ingredients exactly except I only used 1/2 the amount of the condensed sweetner. I will only use this banana pudding recipe. I am now a member of this website because I just had to write a review about this reciepe. I have found a new home for recipes."
"1","5","Try adding cantolope instead of bananas. Delicious!"
"1","5","We all loved this! As the other reviewers suggested I used all light/low fat ingredients, even sugar free pudding! No-one could tell. I also used 2 cups skim milk instead of 3 and 1/2 the can condensed milk. My kids love strawbwrries so we added those as well. They added great color and texture. My 5 year old had a great time helping me layer this and loved pulverizing the cookies to sprinkle on top. He was so proud of the finished product :)"
"1","5","WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE how delicious this is ... I made it once and now it's become the 'staple' desert at my family functions that I am responsible for making :) It's easy !! and AWESOME"
"1","5","Very good recipe. My husband and I both love it but ended up with some waste since it was just the 2 of us eating it. Will 1/2 the recipe next time."
"1","5","very delicous! i made this for a party, it was so simple! everybody kept asking for the recipe.."
"1","5","This is such a great recipe. I made it for 4th of July and everyone loved it. It's so easy, doesn't require an oven. You can't go wrong."
"1","4","This was pretty good, but I wasn't in love with it, even though I LOVE bananas."
"1","5","Absolutely delicious. I HIGHLY recommend the following modifications: (1) use ONLY Vanilla instant pudding as the recipe instructs (do not use banana--its fake!); (2) use only 1 can of condensed milk (up to 1.5, if you like your pudding super-sweet), but 2 is way too much; (3) I left the cream cheese out on my windowsill the night before; in the morning, it was ready to whip. SO many people asked me for this recipe!"
"1","5","So freaking good...I did not change a thing though the next time I think I will add more Nilla Wafers but thats just me!!"
"1","5","This was the absolute best banana pudding we have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly. The whole family raved about it. Thanks for making me look good!"
"1","5","I made this for a family reunion,i probably tripled the recipe. I also used one or two packages of banana pudding along with french vanilla pudding. I used about a bunch and a half of bananas. This was the best banana pudding that I've ever had. My whole family loved it and everybody wanted the recipe. Two relatives were scrapping the sides of the dish to get every drop, it's that good (well, mine was)."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. it was quick to make and everyone thought it tasted delish! will make this again for sure"
"1","5","This recipe was amazing! I made some for a church event and not even two minutes later it was all gone. I even had to make more when I got home because my husband said he didn't get a big enough portion :)"
"1","5","Wonderful pudding. I didn't change a thing. Be sure to let the cream cheese warm to room temperature before you mix it with the condensed milk. I mixed the cream cheese and the condensed milk together completely before adding the pudding mix, milk, and vanilla. It's very rich but tastes great!"
"1","4","good, but very sweet"
"1","5","Yum!!! this is so good. You can't go wrong making this recipe."
"1","5","Wow, awesome. I thought it tasted better the second day, but by the fourth day, it had gotten a little too mushy."
"1","5","WOW! This was a big hit at Wednesday night supper! I gave out a few recipes for it."
"1","5","Even better the next day when the cookies soften a little. Everywhere I take this people BEG for the recipe!"
"1","5","Made this for a work luncheon and it was the first thing finished off. Everyone wants the recipe. I made the recipe as noted except used a 3.5 box each of vanilla and banana cream instant puddings, and 2 cups whole milk. So good!"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful every time! I get compliments on it everywhere I take it...yum :)"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! I followed the instructions and prepared this dessert in a Trifle glass dish on May 24, 2009 (Memorial Day) and it was not only beautiful but great tasting. It was simple, easy and delicious. Definitely a keeper! I've already memorized the ingredients. Thanks Patty!"
"1","5","This was AWESOME! I made it for a BBQ and everyone LOVED it! I used fat free cream cheese and sugar free pudding and sugar free cool whip and it was just sweet enough with the condensed milk. I also used 1 cup less on the milk because i wanted a thicker consistency and it was AMAZING! I think it would also go great if you substituted any other fruit with the bananas, the topping lends itself to so many other flavors like strawberries, or citrus zest in the pudding mixture, etc etc etc. Thank you so much for a delicious and versatile recipe!"
"1","3","I did not like this recipe at all. The cream cheese almost made it taste waxy. Blech. I think I'll stick to the sour cream version."
"1","5","I thought this was very good. Used only 2 1/4 cups SKIM milk and used 3/4 of a can of sweet. cond. milk. WAS PERFECT."
"1","5","I searched this site for a no-cook Banana Pudding to serve for a Mother's Day gathering at my sister-in-laws,it was a hard decision most had good ratings.I decided on this one because of the cream cheese that the others didn't include..this turned out great!everyone raved about it! I chose to use the french vanilla and banana puddings and 2 cups of milk and instead of vanilla wafers,I used the pepperidge farm chessman,I also dipped the bananas in lemon juice.It was so good,my family can't wait for me to make it again..for us! the pudding misture was very creamy,just the right consistancy.Next time I will try with heavy cream, whipped,instead of the cool-whip."
"1","5","YThis is the best babana pudding i've ever had. Made it just like the recipe says. Will definatly mske it again!"
"1","5","I am not even a fan of Banana Pudding but this recipe is AWESOME! After reading a few reviews, I too cut the milk in half and added condensed milk. I also dipped the sliced bananas in a lemon juice/water mix. For decoration added crumbled wafers to the top. Easy to make and delicious to eat. I let a few banana pudding experts sample the dessert, they couldn't believe it."
"1","5","Amazing!! LOVE IT!!!"
"1","5","Yum!"
"1","5","LOVE IT =) Extremely sweet.. but that's what we like! And the best part is it's EASY & quick to throw together."
"1","3","This was a little too sweet for my taste!"
"1","5","SO GOOD!!!! Used 2 packs of pudding, one vanilla and opne French vanilla. Folded an entire tub of cool whip in and used another one for the topping. Served this as a trifle, layered dish. Used a whole box of vanilla wafers too! Next time I would like a bit more banana but it was a huge hit at Easter. Can't wait to make it again!"
"1","5","DELICIOUS! It's a hit and needs NO changes! SUPER yummy!"
"1","5","The best! I used two boxes instant French Vanilla pudding mix, and omitted the vanilla extract. Husband would like it more banana-y, so next time (probably for Easter), I will use one french vanilla and one banana flavored pudding. Thanks so much!"
"1","5","This is FABULOUS!!! I made this following the recipe to a 'T' and it turned out wonderful. I put it in a large glass bowl and it was pretty. The next time I make it I will add less of the condensed milk, only because I dont think all of it is necessary."
"1","5","Love It! And my family did too! My husband's coworkers even asked him to bring some in for them, so I will be making another one (or two) soon. I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 dish, and used slightly more bananas than instructed to cover every bit of the bottom of the pan. I made a slight mistake and mixed all the pudding ingredients without beating the cream cheese first. Consequently, there were tiny specks of cream cheese that didn't fully blend in. Once prepared, you couldn't even tell, but next time I won't omit this step. I also placed vanilla wafers around the edge as is shown in the photo and it looked as scrumptious as it tasted. Will be using this recipe from now on for my banana pudding. Thank you!"
"1","5","This recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! My family and friends loved it and I wanted to eat the WHOLE thing! MAKE IT TODAY!"
"1","5","Perfect the way it is!"
"1","5","Everyone loved this banana pudding! I had to make it for 3 straight get togethers!"
"1","5","Very good!"
"1","3","I made this for my hubby for V-day since banana pudding is his favorite. The flavor was good but entirely too thick for our taste. And even though I left the cream cheese out for hours, it still did not cream well and left lumps in the finished dish."
"1","5","This recipe is absolutely sinful!!! I followed the directions exactly & it turned out perfect! This is the BEST Banana Pudding I have ever eaten. I will make this again frequently!"
"1","4","This was a good recipe - but so amazingly sweet I couldn't stand it. I think this recipe would suffice WITHOUT the can of condensed milk."
"1","5","this recipe was absolutely amazing- an absolute hit with everyone who tried it!!! Definetly a keeper!!"
"1","5","Absolutely EXCELLENT!! I brought this to work and it was the bomb! I must have printed the recipe for at least 15 different people. I wouldn't change a thing, ~but~ I AM going to try it with all ingredients being low fat, no fat, and/or sugar free to see if I can get the calorie count down without sacrificing the flavor. Otherwise, don't change a thing! Wunderbar!"
"1","5","I love this recipe, and I especially love this recipe made with chocolate pudding mix and oreos. I break up the oreos into big chunks and mix in in with the rest. Yum."
"1","5","Absolutely amazing! Everyone who's tried this recipe loves it. It is true about the cream cheese though, make sure it's at room temperature, otherwise you wont ever get rid of the cheese lumps, no matter how much you try. Thankfully, even if you leave the cheese a little lumpy the recipe still tastes great."
"1","5","Easy and delicious!"
"1","5","Someone at work recommended a similar recipe. However I trust All Recipes users and found one very close (this one) with great reviews. I was right to trust All Recipes! I think I'll add more bananas next time though. It was more pudding and whipped cream than banana."
"1","5","wooo weeee just excellent...yummy yummy yummy!!! ty 4 sharing"
"1","5","this was my first time to make Banana Pudding, and it turned out to be a successful attempt. The recipe was easy to follow, and the only modification I made was to cut the cream cheese in half and use the whole box of vanilla wafers. My husband gave me a high-five after he took his first bite...that means it's a keeper! thanks for sharing the recipe"
"1","5","Without a doubt the best banana pudding I have ever tasted!"
"1","5","THIS WAS GREAT"
"1","5","This is an excellent recipe. I follow the ingredients exactly, but depending on how many I am serving, I will sometimes layer this as opposed to using the 13x9 dish. The only thing regarding the recipe is that the cream cheese needs to be softened. If not, you will have lumps. I think you can also use less sweetened condensed milk too (if you happen to be short or would like to cut back to 1/2 the can). I also think that you actually need about 3/4 of the bag of vanilla wafers to get the oh so yummy cookies texture in this. This recipes is AWESOME! Thanks so much for sharing!!"
"1","5","This banana pudding is excellent and my husband and I can't stop eating it! I followed the recipe exactly, and personally, the vanilla pudding portion is my favorite part. YUM!  Two things: 1. I will use a 16 oz container of cool whip for the top the next time I make this. 2. Make sure you eat this as soon as you can since the wafers will get mushy."
"1","5","This recipe is great and really easy! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and mixed vanilla and banana cream pudding mixes. I did make a mistake and failed to completely beat the cream cheese before adding the other ingredients, so there were little lumps of cream cheese throughout the pudding. It still tasted really good and my guests did not seem to notice, but next time I will read the recipe more carefully! I have made several attempts at cooked banana pudding recipes over the years that completely FLOPPED (banana soup, anyone?) but this recipe is so easy and tastes wonderful and rich! It was a big hit at our New Year's Eve dessert & coffee party."
"1","5","I love this recipe. I did change a couple of small things though. I mix everything but the pudding mix very well. Once everything is incoporated, I add the pudding mix. I also use twice the amount of cool whip. Personal preference. I also make mine more as a trifle. Everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe."
"1","5","This recipe was awesome. Everyone loved it and I will for now on make my banana pudding this way. Thanks much!"
"1","5","After beating the cream until fluffy, beat the cream and condensed milk together til smooth. Helps with the texture. Use only vanilla pudding and definitely use the whole can of milk. Cream must be room temperature before blending."
"1","1","Just a head's up...this isn't an egg-free recipe. The vanilla wafers have egg in them. Check ingredients on packaging before you make or serve this to someone with egg allergies."
"1","5","I would give this 10 stars if I could. This is absolutely the best out there. I took the suggestion from another reviewer and used pecan sandies. I crushed them, spread about two thirds in the pan, and sprinkled the rest on top. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME"
"1","5","Every time I make this it's a hit. To avoid lumping, I always mix the cream cheese and condensed milk first. Then I add the pudding, milk, and vanilla. I also don't use as many bananas as the recipe calls for."
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding ever! I've made this several times for potlucks at work and for family get togethers. Everyone always wants a copy of the recipe!! I've even made this several times with reduced fat and sugar free ingredients (like reduced fat vanilla waffers and sugar free instant vanilla pudding) and it still turned out GREAT!!!"
"1","5","I made this pudding for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! The best banana pudding I have ever had! Definitely a keeper!"
"1","5","This is an AWESOME recipe. I loved it and so did my family. I followed the recipe exactly and it was GREAT!!!"
"1","5","Absolutely perfect!"
"1","5","very yummy. I followed others advice and used 1 banana pudding and 1 vanilla. I used less milk and the pudding was almost too thick. I'll use the recomended amount next time and see if it's better."
"1","5","Loved this recipe! Brought it to a girl's get-together and everyone loved it! My husband had some later and everyone thought it tasted like Banana Creme Pie! Next time may add extra vanilla wafers to the bottom to make a thicker 'crust'."
"1","4","This was good and I will make again. My family liked it and my 2 year old enjoyed helping me prepare/assemble it. I made it in a bowl with two layers and it looked as good as it tasted. Next time, I am going to try the Tiramisu recipe that is very similar to this (minus the bananas + coffee) located on the back of the Nilla wafer box."
"1","5","Best banana pudding ever!!!"
"1","5","Found this recipe to make for a friend's birthday because its her favorite dessert. She said its the best banana pudding she's ever had. Only downfall is that I didn't have any leftovers! And take the suggestion to coat the bananas with Fruit Fresh. Worked great. Thanks!"
"1","5","I doubled the recipe (kind of hard to do in regular-sized mixer), but it still turned out great. We ate some a few hours after chilling, and it was still a bit liquidy. But by the next day, it was the perfect texture. And it tastes just how banana pudding should."
"1","5","This was a big hit at our family reunion and I was surprised at just how much the cream cheese changes/adds to the flavor compaired to banana pudding without it!  The only changes I made was to double the amount of wafers (my husband says there's usually not enough in traditional recipes for his taste) and I layered them such that the bottom of the 9 x 13 was covered and then I put down half the pudding mixture and bananas and then more wafers and then the rest of the mixture and the 'frosting' layer. I forgot to add the vanilla in but with the vanilla pudding, you don't really need it!"
"1","4","Very nice recipe, easy, creamy, rich. I like the fact that it is no bake, the bananas didn't turn that yucky grey color they sometimes do when heated. This is a keeper, I'm taking it to my family reunion this weekend, I am sure it will be a hit.   I do think next time I'll use neufatel cheese instead of cream cheese. I think it might cut down on the richness a bit.  It set up beautifully, great presentation! Even better the next day."
"1","4","Yummy, I had to make some changes though... I used about 3/4 of the can of condensed milk, an extra banana, and almost all the vanilla wafers. I also made my whipped cream as opposed to cool whip. I put it in a bigger dish so I could do more layers and it turned out very good - rich though :)"
"1","3","First of all, the cream cheese didn't blend well and there were a lot of lumps. I don't know if I should have left it out room temperature so it would blend easier. The condensed milk made it way to sweet.. I choose this recipe for simplicity and great reviews, but my batch didn't turn out so well."
"1","5","My 13-year-old daughter and I made it last night. It was Awesome! I will definitely be making then again.  My daughter gives it five stars Thanks!"
"1","4","Quick and easy. Very good. Makes a large batch."
"1","4","rich and creamy pudding, had a good flavor. I used the 2 boxes of 3.75oz with 3 cups of milk , it was thicker than the old fashion banana pudding that I'm used to. The custord of the pudding reminded me of the filling in the banana twin cakes."
"1","4","a bit too sweet but still the crowd loved it."
"1","5","I substituted low fat cream cheese, whipped topping, and vanilla wafers, and everyone agreed that this was the best banana pudding they'd ever had. Thanks very much for posting this recipe!!"
"1","5","Excellent recipe!! I am asked to make this now at every event which is much simpler to bring than my other dishes. My changes are: I use french vanilla pudding, 1/2 (14oz) can of sweetened milk, cream cheese must be at room temperature and I dip my bananas in lemon juice to prevent browning."
"1","5","this was good, but it makes A LOT. only make if you have a family of 6 or are going to a party"
"1","5","This is the best tasting banana pudding recipe that I have ever made. Very quick and easy to make."
"1","5","Oh my god I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was it just gets better with time. Everyone loved this and wants the recipe"
"1","5","This is sinful. I love it. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and you would never know the differnce. Very good recipe. It was gone in a family of 3 in less than 24 hours. :)"
"1","5","I love this recipe and have made it several times over the past few years. I do modify a few things: use fat free cool whip, cream cheese, and condensed milk, and 2% milk. (Never made it the other way and it's still always had a rich taste.) Ironically, I don't like bananas in my banana pudding, so I use one 3.5 french vanilla pudding and one 3.5 banana flavored pudding and it comes out great!"
"1","5","I made some changes and used low fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk, sugar free pudding, fat free cool whip, and reduced fat vanilla wafers. I followed other reviews to reduce the milk to 2 cups but it was too thick. Next time I try 2 1/2 to 3 cups of milk.Great flavor and pretty presentation in a trifle bowl."
"1","5","This is the absolute best banana pudding ever. I've made it twice now and everybody loves it and wants the recipe. So rich and creamy. MMM!!!"
"1","5","This was all that was promised and more. My family loved it. If I changed anything at all I added more cookies and Bananas, but not many! It was wonderful just as submitted!"
"1","5","I tried this recipe this weekend and it was really wonderful. I did follow the suggestions of a few others by using 2 cups of milk instead of 3; tossing the banana slices in lemon juice; and using the French Vanilla pudding and the Banana Cream pudding mixes. I also added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to the mixture for an added boast of flavor. I layered it all in a trifle bowl and it was beautiful as well as tasty! My family loved it!!!"
"1","5","I really enjoyed this recipe. I did use the two small puddings (3.4 oz. each) instead of one 5 oz. Next time I will use the 5 oz. vanilla because I found the pudding to be a bit sweet. Other than that it was very easy to make and tasted great!!"
"1","5","Very good. The whole family loved it. I will make this recipe again."
"1","5","This recipe was amazing. I did change it slightly though. I used 1 3.5 oz pkg vanilla pudding, and 1 3.5 oz pkg of banana cream pudding. I also took about 10 vanilla wafers, put them in a plastic bag and broke them up into small/medium chunks. I also sliced up another 1 1/2 bananas and put both the broken up vanilla wafers and extra banana in the pudding mix before putting it into the dish. Between 4 adults this went in a heartbeat. Will definitely make this again and again!"
"1","5","Wow...this recipe is unbelievable!!!! Everyone loved this dessert!!! i cannot wait until I make it again. I too changed teh recipe just a bit..1st. I used a small box of instant banana pudding, and a small box of instant vanilla pudding, 2nd I made sure that the milk was very cold. I made this recipe on the fourth of July and Walmart was out of the Jello brand so I used Walmart's and I guess it did not matter because, this pudding came out awesome!!!! This is definately a keeper."
"1","5","My first attempt at this didn't go so well but I tried it again with much better results. Be sure you're cream cheese is room temperature or you'll have nothing but lumps. I wish I'd chilled a little longer so my Nilla Wafers weren't as crunchy."
"1","2","This is SUPER rich! I thought it was a bit too sweet with the canned milk. Maybe use 1/2 of it instead. My husband loved it, I could hardly eat it. I think I will stick with making it with plain 'ole pudding."
"1","4","I was very pleased with the outcome of this recipe, even though I completely messed it up! I used a small box of french vanilla pudding, instead of a large box. I did cut back on the amount of milk (2 1/4 cups). The taste and flavor was good, and I look forward to making this again the CORRECT way:)"
"1","5","I do NOT have a sweet tooth at all....but after eating this I'm a changed woman. I followed the directions EXACTLY and was so pleased....and so were all of my coworkers. Thanks so much for a delicious dessert!!!"
"1","4","I fallowed the recipe to the T. I took this to a pitch-in today and every one loved it. I, on the other hand, thought it could have been a little heavier. I was expecting it to be heavier sice it had the pudding and cream cheese in it. It was still really good and I will make it again....maybe I just mixed it too long."
"1","4","This is really good. I omitted the bananas, otherwise made as listed. Even though I used room temp cream cheese and creamed it well, I still got small lumps of cream cheese floating in the mix. It doesn't detract from the taste, however, only the texture."
"1","5","This is a very good recipe. I can't wait for my husband to get home and try some. Thanks for posting it!"
"1","5","I can't say enough about this recipe. My family is southern (Texas & South Carolina) so I grew up on the occasional banana pudding. No one in my family had ever tasted anything remotely good as this. This has been added to my list of 'you must make this at every family gathering' recipes. I used the extra-creamy cool whip and didn't notice a hint of 'fakeness' as others mentioned, but I can see how you might get that with regular or even low fat. When I make this, I make it all the way!"
"1","5","I made this recipe exactly as written, except I layered it in a decorative glass bowl for presentation. It is absolutely delicious- my family would eat it every day if given the opportunity!!!"
"1","5","YUMMY! Thanks."
"1","5","This stuff is so good that I just want to eat it for dinner.   I think I will only make this for holiday gatherings from now on so I don't gain 100 pounds."
"1","5","This recipe is SOO good! I accidentally put all the whipped cream in at once, but it was still awesome! Pretty fluffy, but really good."
"1","5","This is the best Banana Pudding ever. It is addicting. I have put in individual cups and my family cant get enough. I get request for it from everyone, even ppl who dont even eat Banana Pudding. Love it."
"1","5","I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious!! I did use common sense, however and let the cream cheese come to room temperature. Next time I make this I might try it with real whipped cream instead of cool whip. :)"
"1","5","ABSOLUTELY DELISH!! The whole family loved it!! I think I might try this with banana extract next time to give it a more banana flavor."
"1","5","i've made this recipe a couple of times over the last month. it is a wonderful recipe. the custard is rich and creamy. i have received many compliments on this recipe. i made it exactly as instructed and i love it. the best ever!"
"1","5","Perfect! I followed the ingredients in the recipe to a T. I followed the advice of others and made sure the cream cheese was at room temperature. I also used a round pyrex dish and ended up with two layers. I used a whole box of vanilla waferS. I also placed cookies up the side of the dish for presentation. The best Banana pudding I have ever had. Even the husband loved it and he was very skeptical at first, he went back for a second bowl. This is a keeper! I plan on making it as the dessert for my twin girls 1st birthday party."
"1","4","Really good the night I made it. But like others have said. If you leave it in the fridge a day or so the crackers get soggy and the bananas brown."
"1","5","Made this for Easter and really enjoyed it - only had 3 bananas, but that didn't seem to bother it. As another reviewer suggested, I broke up the wafers and that was a great suggestion, as it made it easier to serve and eat. Thanks for the recipe, Patty."
"1","5","I give this 5+ stars! My husband is a self proclaimed banana pudding expert and he said this was the BEST he has EVER eaten. I have seen others comment on the pudding being too runny, perhaps they accidentally used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk - it would definitely make a big difference. Anyway, I only altered the recipe by using nearly an entire box of the mini vanilla wafers, fat free Eagle Brand, skim milk, and Lite Cool Whip - I also layered it in a casserole dish. This is a keeper for our family recipes."
"1","5","I had help from my 5 yr old grandson and 4 year old granddaughter to make this. When we got to the tasting part, my grandson's quote was 'it's sooooooo good' and he is right. It was easy and fun to make and tastes great."
"1","5","Made for a church luncheon and it was very well received. It was very good for a no-cook recipe. The cream cheese made it velvety smooth. I made no changes to the recipe."
"1","4","definitely a keeper, but I liked the taste even better before I added the whipped cream. Maybe next time I will put whipped cream only on the top.   It looked great...tasted great too."
"1","5","I've tried to submit my review earlier, but hopefully this one will go and there won't be 2! Anyway...I took this dish to a church dinner and everyone raved over it. I actually saw a few women hiding pieces of it. These are seasoned cooks...so I felt very proud. The recipe is very easy. I really made no changes except I had to use Lite topping because the store was out of the regular. I also crushed up cookies on the top. I made it about 5 hrs before serving. I wanted to make it the night before but was afraid the bananas would turn dark. However, I was told by someone that making the night before is ok as they prefer the cookies soft. I guess its a matter of taste. I highly recommend this recipe!"
"1","5","DE-LISH!!!! This was VERY good!!!! :) We finally had this today (made a day ago) and my oh my!!! Ours tasted a little rich but we topped w/chocolate sauce so that could be why. I followed others suggestions and coated my bananas w/a lemon juice/water mixture so they wouldnt brown, and I also blended some bananas in with the pudding to give it a little more banana flavor! I also only had a small package of pudding not 5 oz...and still tasted great!!! Made our own vanilla wafers. Looked pretty, and will make again! :)"
"1","5","I've been making this recipe for nearly 15 years now. It has become a requirement at family reunions, holidays, etc. Over time, I often tweak recipes to suit my tastes. But I've made very few changes with this one. It's practically perfect as stated. Here are the few changes I make: I use two small boxes of French vanilla pudding instead of the 5 oz vanilla. I omit the whipped topping and add unsweetened whipped cream instead (one pint of heavy cream beaten to stiff peaks). I'm not a fan of whipped topping and think the unsweetened cream cuts back a bit on the sugar level. I sprinkle the banana slices with lemon juice to prevent browning. I've used shortbread cookies at times. Both the shortbread and wafers work well. I've used both whole milk and low-fat and have never noticed a difference. This is a great banana pudding recipe. I'm sure it will be a hit for you too."
"1","5","All time favorite - the best!"
"1","5","I made the recipe EXACTLY as it is written and it was excellent!!!!! I actually made 3 in one week because so many people were going crazy over it and wanted some to take home!  This recipe is perfect in every way. I don't reccomend changing it at all! Replacing the vanilla pudding with banana flavored would make it taste fake. The only change I made was adding more vanilla wafers because I always like extra cookies!"
"1","5","WOW!!! This was FANTASTIC!!!! I took it to work for a co-worker's birthday. Everyone absolutely loved it! I did follow suggestions given ie: blended cream cheese and eagle brand milk together, blended ingredients in a blender, used low fat alternatives and I added chopped walnuts to top with vanilla wafers. (I also added a about 1/4 tsp. of Almond extract in addition to the vanilla). I can't wait to make it again."
"1","2","this wasn't anything special - it was just ok. My family didn't finish it and that's a miracle. Maybe we were expecting more based on the reviews."
"1","5","Very yummy. I used 2 boxes of sugar free vanilla instant pudding and 2 percent milk.   I also used angel food cake instead of vanilla wafers.. I put it in a trifle bowl. I think next time instead of bananas I am going to use strawberries."
"1","5","I made this for a church function. I scaled the recipe to serve 60! It came out perfect. I don't know how many people came up to me raving about this banana pudding. It was very easy to make even when preparing enough for 60 people. This recipe is a keeper!!"
"1","5","FANTASTIC!!!!! THIS ONE WAS SUCH A HIT, I MADE IT 3 TIMES WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF EVER TRYING THIS RECIPE!!! WONDERFUL, RICH TASTE...YOU CAN'T STOP EATING IT!! YUMMMMY!!!!!"
"1","5","wow.this was wonderful.I made only half because I thought a full 9x13 pan would be too much for two.It went beyond seconds.My husband suggested using a chocholate layer on top instead of whipped ropping .I'm going to make it soon that way. Thanks. for sure a keeper."
"1","5","I took this to a church function, and it was the first dessert to be gone. It was completely gone within 10 minutes. I left the cream cheese out in room temp for about 45 minutes so that it was easier to beat. I used 3/4 of the sweet condensed milk, but it was still too sweet so I'll probably use about half next time. I used a round bowl and made two layers. It was great!"
"1","5","Absolutely wonderful! I made it today with fat free condensed milk, low fat cream cheese and 1% milk and it was fabulous! I did use just over half of the condensed milk after reading the reviews. :)"
"1","4","Yummy, a little sickening sweet though - do not serve this in large portions, your guests may have trouble finishing. Bananas brown after a couple of days in the fridge so best to make a day or less ahead of serving."
"1","2","I thought this was way to sweet when I followed the recipe. Next time I might try less of the condensed milk."
"1","5","Excellent recipe just as is. Very kid friendly and husband loved it too :)...said he was eating it slow so he didn't eat too much :). If you are entertaining and not worrying about fat, I suggest using 2 packs of cream cheese ( can use lower fat version) for a more rich, creamy dessert."
"1","5","great dessert. quick, easy and delicious. when I went to the store to get some banana's - they were all green. so I used banana chips instead. I layered them over the cookie base. the dessert had about 3 hours to sit, and the chips did soften a bit (still had a little crunch). I think they would have softened more if I had put a thin layer of pudding down on top of the cookies,then the chips, then the rest of the pudding. but believe me, it was something only I noticed because there were no leftovers!!"
"1","5","Oh Yeah! This one's a keeper. Delicious and extremely easy to make!"
"1","5","this was so amazing! i'm not even a big fan of banana pudding, but my pregnant friend at work is, hhaha so i made it for her. you cannot go wrong with cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla. even i loved it. our friends went back for thirds. i made this in a trifle bowl and loaded up on the banana and wafer layers."
"1","5","Very Yummy!! If you soak the banana slices in lemon juice they won't turn brown. It lasted 3 days in the fridge before they got yucky! MMM!"
"1","5","My whole family loved this recipe. I left out the condensed milk, because I'm not a fan of things that are super sweet. I also used low fat milk, cool whip, and low fat cream cheese. It was still really good, and it was lighter. I'm sure it wasn't as sweet as the original recipe, but we loved it. I'm sure to make it again soon."
"1","5","I love this recipe!!! I made it and took it to work and everyone raved over it. It was gone right away. It was very easy to make. It is really the best Banana pudding I have ever had."
"1","5","I don't like bananas and I don't like pudding, but everyone I work with and everyone I live with LOVES it, so I made it. This recipe was a huge success with all. Half of it was gone before lunch--the rest was lunch! I followed the recipe exactly, except I crushed more Nilla wafers on top like suggested. I was told it was awesome and everyone wanted the recipe!"
"1","5","This is my favorite and only banana pudding recipe. I knew it was good the first time I made it but it continued to get better. One thing that I realized I needed to do to maintain just the right amount of sweetness was to avoid using the entire can of sweet condensed milk. Once you start folding in the whipped cream it becomes way too sweet. I didn't know this until the next day.  Once I decided to make the banana pudding again I mixed in half a can of the sweet condensed milk then begin to finger taste it after every few pours. To turn out just right, when tasting the mixture, the pudding should taste just a tad bit too sweet and then once it sits overnight, the vanilla wafers and bananas balance out that extra flavor of sweetness and it becomes perfect. I took this to a school potluck and there's an older teacher the school who sought me out just to tell me that this banana pudding reminded her of the one her grandmothers used to make. From that day on I knew this would be my potluck dessert of choice."
"1","5","I made this last weekend, using reduced fat cream cheese and lite Cool whip. It is sooo good!!! And instead of making it in a 9x13 dish, I made individual portions in ramekins. I crushed the cookies for the crust, then put in the pudding, Cool Whip and put about 5 sliced bananas on top along with one wafer. Delicious!!!"
"1","5","I omitted bananas and used a can of cherry pie filling on top. I also used a graham cracker crust instead of the vanilla wafers. My guests loved it."
"1","5","This was fantastic! Everybody just loved it and I've been asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed is I put the whole vanilla wafers on the bottom and crushed wafers on top, as others recommended."
"1","5","I have never been a fan of banana pudding, but this recipe is pure goodness."
"1","5","Great recipe. I cut my milk back to about 1 1/2 cups. We like our pudding a little thicker. Definitely a keeper, thanks!"
"1","5","So good. My husband asks for this ALL the time!"
"1","5","I made this exactly as written (unusual for me, as I almost always 'tweak' recipes). This is awesome! Thanks!"
"1","5","Very good, best banana pudding ever. I hate the taste of instant pudding, but all the other ingredients that are added to this instant pudding take it to a higher level and it is delicious. I halved the recipe and it was still great."
"1","5","This recipe really doesn't need another 5 star rating, but I just can't help myself!!! OUTRAGEOUSLY DELICIOUS! My daughter and I were fighting over who got to dip the leftover vanilla wafers into the filling left behind in the bowl!!"
"1","5","Made this today for a cookout.Of course we had to taste it first. This is so good. I added a little extra to the topping. After topping it with the whipped cream I crushed up the waffers and butterfinger bars and sprinkled on the top.Looks really good and the taste is to die for. LOL.."
"1","5","Great recipe! Took this to a dinner club last night and everyone asked for the recipe. I used fat free condensed milk, low fat cream cheese, and fat free whipped topping. I beat the cream cheese and condensed milk together first, then added the pudding mix and vanilla and beat again until smooth. I gradually added the milk in last. Layered in a trifle bowl and topped with crushed wafers."
"1","5","What a delicious recipe. Very easy to make and my guests loved it. I made it a few weeks ago and my husband just asked for it again."
"1","5","YUM! Best Banana Pudding I have ever tasted! Didn't change a thing. Perfect as is. THANKS so much!"
"1","5","Absolutely delicious!!!"
"1","5","So good that people licked the plates. Only used 2 cups of milk otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly."
"1","5","Very Rich!!! Everyone loved this. People talked about it all afternoon."
"1","5","Very enjoyable. I always add one more banana to mine. It makes a lot."
"1","5","this is incredible, easy, really yummy banana pudding!! i made it and layered it in a trifle bowl-- it looked so nice. the inlaws gobbled it up!"
"1","5","I made this dessert for Easter and eveyone loved it!!! The only thing I changed was that I used Lorna Doone shortbread cookies instead of vanilla wafers and I used a nice glass bowl instead of 9x13 dish. I just layered the cookies then slices of bananas then the pudding. Since I only had 1 container of the whipped topping I put some in the pudding like asked then I put 1/2 on the bottom layer then the rest on the top and added slices of bananas a couple of cookies and finely diced walnuts for a little decoration on top. This was very yummy and easy to make."
"1","5","This was great! I used fat free everywhere I could. I only used 3/4 can fat free sweetened condensed milk and I only used 2 bananas (1 slice per cookie). I added the whole 8 oz whipped topping to the pudding instead of 1/2. I finished the layers off with pudding and sprinkled crushed cookie crumbs on top. I was told it was the best banana pudding they ever had! It was gobbled up very quick! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"1","5","I always get a bit overwhelemed when looking in the Jello/pudding section of the grocery store. I didn't even know that they made a 5oz box of Pudding. So inadvertantly I grabbed one small Fat-Free, Sugar Free, Not realizing it was only 1 oz. Needless to say, after 4 hours in the fridge my pudding was no where near setting. So After reading through many reviews, somewhere around page 6, I came to someone who claimed that her supermarket was out of 5 oz. and she got 2 smaller ones instead. *Bingo* I went back to the store and started all over again. I am so thankful I did. This was not only the best Banana Pudding I have ever had, it is the best pudding I have ever had. Try it! Just note that it is 5 oz. of instant vanilla pudding."
"1","4","You have to pace yourself with this one when eating however, it is oooohhhh so good! It's a tad on the rich side. I will be making this again with one exception; I will try reducing the sweet condensed milk and cream cheese a bit in hopes to reduce the overall richness of the pudding."
"1","4","This was an easy, simple recipe but wonderful!! My husband had a craving for banana pudding and I never made it before so I was looking for an easy one. I found almost every ingredient in my fridge except the Nilla wafers and the whipped topping. I mixed in the topping instead of topping the pudding with it. I also used Cool Whip Lite instead. I will also opt to use sugar free vanilla pudding next time because the condensed milk already makes it so sweet. I sprinkled it with crushed Nilla wafers. It was yummy! Hit the spot, and my husband was beyond pleased! I'll take a picture next time, it was so pretty!"
"1","5","Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! My MIL even asked for the recipe!"
"1","5","What a better pudding than the usual instant vanilla pudding over nilla wafers and ba nanas. This is so good-Suggestion to mix the pudding, milk, condensed milk, cream cheese, and vanilla in a blender. It splattered a lot while mixing even in a large bowl. Not a big deal-Would make again!! YUMMY!"
"1","5","the best banana pudding i have ever had!"
"1","5","This was very good but extremely rich. I've since changed to another recipe that isn't so rich and doesn't sit so heavily on the stomach. But, I'm still giving a 5-star rating because it was tasty, if you like very rich puddings."
"1","5","This banana pudding is delicious! I was worried at first that the pudding mixture seemed really thin. However, it thickened up in the fridge and got really creamy! MMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!"
"1","5","I made this the first time for a potluck at my husband's work. At the most recent potluck he didn't get a choice on what to bring everyone TOLD him he was bringing the banana pudding again! Very easy to make. I alternated the layers."
"1","5","It has been a hit since its introduction into my family. This pudding is heavenly, but ooooh my stomach!"
"1","5","This is amazing, no changes needed. I like to layer it in a glass bowl, it's enough to do 3 layers of wafers and bananas. A pretty dessert and people just go crazy over it. Make sure cream cheese is room temp. and mix it with the condensed milk till smooth so you don't end up with lumps. Also very good with banana cream/vanilla puddings mixed."
"1","5","Awesome! Family and friends loved it. This one stays in the RECIPE BOX."
"1","5","Sooo good and easy too. We loved this :)"
"1","5","The vanilla wafers totally make this banana pudding a hit!! I used low fat anything and everything that I could for this pudding. It turned out GREAT!!"
"1","5","I have another banana pudding recipe that I've used in the past and this one is just as good, if not better. I made this for a pool party that was cancelled due to rain, so now I have the whole thing sitting in my frige! Luckily, we have alot of neighborhood kids who come over. They loved it."
"1","5","I took this to work and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I used an extra large 9x9 pan and it was very thick and tasty. Thanks."
"1","5","This is the best banana pudding I ever tasted. My family and friends loved it. This is a keeper!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","very good!!"
"1","5","I loved this recipe. It's so easy. I added more vanilla wafers though."
"1","5","I made this yesterday; it turned out wonderful! The flavor was on point, its a great recipe!!"
"1","5","Always a hit at family gatherings. I get requests to make this!"
"1","5","We had this pudding at a cookout on the lake! Best I have EVER had! The vanilla wafers were substituted by the thin Peppridge Farm cookies with the chocolate in the middle! Those cookies are expensive but it is definately worth it!"
"1","5","I've never liked banana pudding, but decided to make this for my boyfriend who really does. I was pleasantly suprised by this pudding, even I enjoyed the floavor and texture and the banana flavor was subtle, not overpowering. I used french vanilla pudding mix and low fat milk and whipped topping to make it healthier. The recipe makes ALOT, certainly too much for two people, next time I'll plan it for a group."
"1","4","Great recipe. My only change would be to make it with 1/2 banana pudding and 1/2 vanilla pudding. I would like for it to have more 'banana' flavor without the artificial banana taste that some banana puddings have. I will also add more wafers next time. There is a lot of pudding! Family loved it."
"1","5","absolutely the best I've ever had. It even beats the homemade pudding recipe I have."
"1","5","This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I make it very often."
"1","5","Outstanding! The only change I made was to increase the bananas to five instead of four. We just like a little more of the real banana flavor."
"1","5","wonderful"
"1","5","This is a sinfully delicious pudding. When ever you really would like a 'comfort' food that really does the trick, this is it! Made me feel like a little kid, again. :)"
"1","5","VERY VERY YUMMY!"
"1","5","This is great. I made it as is, except I cut the condensed milk by half as suggested by other reviewers. It was still plenty sweet, even too sweet for some. Next time I may cut it even more.   One thing...this definitely isn't an authentic banana pudding. Most people expect the cooked version, but this is a great no-bake version. I'm enjoying the leftovers."
"1","5","This recipe is easy to make and my whole family loves it. Thanks Pat"
"1","4","I was really excited about this recipe but my husband and I thought it was way too sweet. Of course my kids loved it and they are still bouncing off the walls coming down off their sugar high. Maybe I will try it again and tweak it a little."
"1","5","Fantastic and very easy. I make this recipe all the time and have many requests for it."
"1","5","First time making banana pudding, fantastic. Very easy and taste just like I hoped it would. I did not add the rest of the whipped topping as top layer because I am big on consistency, cream on top of cream did not sound good to me. It came out just fine."
"1","5","I like the homemade banana pudding you bake in the oven, but I LOVE this instant recipe."
"1","3","This recipe was just so-so...but maybe just banana pudding as a whole isn't all that amazing..."
"1","5","One word to describe this recipe.... YUMMYYYYYYYY!!!! I used whipped cream cheese so I wouldn't have to hassle with whipping a block of it. I also added a box of banana cream pudding mix to the recipe. Took it to a dinner party and it was a hit!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe! I have a feeling I'll be making this a lot from now on! This is a perfect dessert for a picnic or BBQ, and it's sure to impress friends.  I followed some of the suggestions from the other reviews. I used 6 bananas instead of 4 and tossed them with lemon juice. I also used a small box of vanilla pudding and a small box of banana pudding. I decreased the cold milk from 3 to 2.5 cups, and used a 12 oz. whipped topping instead of 8 oz. I also used fat-free condensed sweetened milk."
"1","4","I made this for my coworkers (who love to eat) and it was a hit. I reduced the milk to 2 1/2 cups and layered the cookies twice so they didn't get real soggy (2 layers of cookies, layer of bananas, layer of pudding in a deep pan and repeated layers until I had about 3 layers -- of course I doubled the recipe). My coworkers have paid me to make it again for our father's day luncheon tomorrow."
"1","5","What a fun dessert! I prepared this for a potluck and it was the first to go. I had a very large straight sided bowl, so I actually made this recipe plus another half recipe. Do make it the day before, it softens the vanilla wafers some. Thank you!! A keeper!!"
"1","5","this recipe is delicious. My family enjoyed it. I will be preparing this for all of the parties"
"1","5","DELICIOUS!!! One change that I made was I used the entire box of Vanilla Wafers to make a two-layer pudding."
"1","4","Delicious! This is a very nice, flavorful, creamy banana pudding. I made a few changes: took suggestion of other reviewers and used 1 box french vanilla and 1 box banana cream instant pudding. I also used lowfat condensed milk, lowfat cream cheese and light Cool Whip--and it still tastes great. Thanks for the recipe!! Am about to take some over to my parents."
"1","5","I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and there was not a bit left by the end of the day. I have a tendency to mess up recipes, but this one was super easy to follow and super easy to make. It tasted GREAT!"
"1","3","I'm not a big fan of banana cream pie, but if you are than this desert is a 5 star"
"1","5","This is really good. It even taste better the next day once the wafers sit in it. I use more bananas."
"1","4","First time I made this, the cream cheese was lumpy. But it still tasted yummy, so I made it again. This time I let the cream cheese soften to room temp, then added the condensed milk a little at a time. No lumps. Very creamy and tasty."
"1","5","This is excellent! I made it last night for the first time. While taste-testing it last night, I thought it was too sweet. Once it settled overnight, I think the extra sweetness diminished some. My tastebuds love it and so does my sister. It was so easy to make! This recipe is a keeper. I will be taking this to the next potluck event."
"1","5","Very creamy and light. I loved it and wouldn't make any changes to the recipe. However, a couple of my friends are quite picky and do not like artificial flavors of instant pudding. So, next time I make this recipe, I will use homemade custard (pudding) to give it a more 'realistic' taste. Hopefully it will turn out just as good."
"1","5","This is my husbands (and one of mine!) favorite dessert. I make it regularly and never get tired of it-it's wonderful!"
"1","5","This is fantastic!! I first made this dish about a year ago, and I have been famous for it ever since. I have never had a person not like it. In fact, people that don't even like banana pudding try this and love it! The only thing different that I do is to use low-fat cream cheese, condensed milk, or Cool Whip. However, if you use the low-fat versions of all three ingredients, the mixture is too runny. So, I normally just do one low-fat ingredient in a batch. Also, I make two or three layers with the bananas and Nilla wafers in between. Layers are great! Thanks again Patricia; you've made me the banana pudding queen! :)"
"1","5","This is a terrific recipe I have already used many times. You can use reduced fat ingredients and no one will know the difference."
"1","5","YUMMY! This is delicious! I layered it in a trifle bowl. Easy and very tasty! Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
"1","5","FIVE STAR BANANA PUDDING! This is the absolute best 'BP' ever! For such a simple dessert, it tastes so rich and decadent!"
"1","5","This was great!!! I was really wanting some banana pudding and this hit the spot, the cream cheese made it perfect!!!"
"1","5","Much creamier than the standard side of the box recipe. Went very fast!"
"1","5","Every single time I make this, the dish is emptied and people are asking for more. A great alternative to the traditional baked version, and perhaps, just better all around."
"1","5","I have been making this for years now. I save myself some work buy using pre made graham cracker crust. This recipe makes three pies. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY, I brought this to a potluck birthday dinner. And felt really bad when no one at the birthday cake because they were all devouering themselves in this pudding.  enjoy!"
"1","5","Rich and luscious. My banana pudding lovers gobbled this up. The recipe is fairly easy, but be forwarned that this makes a LOT of banana pudding. Suggestion: For a more beautiful presentation and a better mixing of the flavors, make repeated layers of wafers, bananas, and pudding mixture."
"1","5","My family loves this recipe. The only thing we do differently -- use a blender to mix all the ingredients -- it seems to thicken quicker, plus everything is mixed well, no lumps. A wonderful, wonderful recipe. Never any leftovers."
"1","5","I have made this recipe several times and never had a chance to leave my review. This is the BEST BP recipe I have ever tried. I have made this for for every holiday this year, but for Thanksgiving, I used strawberries instead of bananas and the in-laws were very pleased thanks to you... AAA+++"
"1","5","If I could give this five more stars, I WOULD. Big hit at my house. Had company over and made this dish real quick, and it was great. I will keep the dish a secret though. Thank you for a great dessert. Have a good one."
"1","5","I loved this recipe. I used Neufchatel cheese, fat-free condensed milk and whipped topping, and low-fat vanilla wafers. I also put this into a slightly smaller sized dish and made 2 layers, rather than one. My family polished the whole thing off in 2 days. It is delicious and a fast and easy dish appropriate for company, as well as family. Thanks, Patricia, for a real winner!"
"1","4","I really liked this recipe. I love to cook but I am a mother of a toddler so I cant spend a lot of time in the kitchen.. This was very easy to make and didnt take any 'special' ingredients. There was only a couple minor things that i didnt like about this recipe. The cream cheese was lumpy, and i didnt think there was enough whip cream in it. Other then that i would definately recomend this to anyone!"
"1","5","Excellent--definitely use one 3.4oz pkg vanilla and one 3.4oz pkg banana pudding mix, and I reduce the milk to 2.5 cups. Everything else is the same, and it kicks butt. Everyone loves it, it's easy to make, no baking to mess up, yum!"
"1","5","YUMMY! This was super delicious. The only thing I did different is to add a small box of vanilla pudding. It just seemed to thin to me with the one large (5 oz) box. It turned out fantastic. Everyone raved about it and thought I had whipped the pudding as it was sooooo creamy. This is a keeper and I will definately make this again and again. Thanks so much."
"1","5","This recipe is simple sinful. I have made it twice now. The longer it chills the better it is. Thanks for a keeper"
"1","5","One of the best banana puddings I've ever had! One thing I do is to put down a thin layer of filling before putting in the nilla wafers and bananas. After putting in the remainder of the filling, I shake the dish back and forth and side to side which helps spread the bananas so they aren't just on the bottom."
"1","5","Don't change a thing! This is great just the way it is."
"1","5","Fabulous!!!"
"1","3","This recipe was good but it never seemed to set and was very mushy. I used banana pudding and it still didn't have a very strong banana flavor."
"1","5","I don't usually like bannana pudding. But I thought I would try this as a dessert for Easter. Everyone including me loved it. We had several desserts to choose from but this one was the only one gone at the end. Thanks for the GREAT recipe. We will make in many more times."
"1","5","I brought this recipe of banana pudding home for the holidays and the clan just loved it. Ever since then I have been asked to make it again for every family function. For a bunch of picky eaters it was nice to have everyone enjoying the same thing. Very easy to make as well!!"
"1","5","Awesome recipe!!! My family loved it! Definitely will make again even for special occasions since it makes alot"
"1","5","I give it five stars because it is a very good recipe, was not sweet at all. My husband loved this he licked the bowl CLEAN after I put it in the pan. Thank you patricia from lil patricia"
"1","5","This recipe is AWESOME! I made it for our Christmas Party at work and everyone loved it. It was the hit of the party. I added a little sugar to mine, a tiny bit of lemon flavor, and a lot of cookies, it was totally delicious!!!!!!!!!"
"1","5","Awesome, awesome, awesome!!"
"1","5","Delicious! Lots of raves! Used 1 of vanilla, one of bananna. The wafers did get a little soft by the next day."
"1","5","All my husband wanted for his birthday cake was banana pudding. He was so happy with this and we gobbled it up! It is so awesome! Thanks for such a good recipe!"
"1","5","Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. I followed the others and used 1 box vanilla and 1 box banana cream. Excellent recipe. Will use this one from now on. Thanks."
"1","5","My husband loves this recipe. Thank you."
"1","5","This was hands-down THE BEST banana pudding I've ever had! 'Nuff said!"
"1","5","OH MY GOSH!!! This is the best banana pudding recipe I have ever had - I have made this twice in two days!! The first day was on Fathers Day and there was NONE left!! I made it again the day after - this time using Banana cream pudding instead of vanilla (only because I didn't have any more vanilla) and it was just as good and I even forgot the whipped topping!! A+++++ recipe!"
"1","5","I have made this twice now and both times it has been a huge hit. This last time I made it I didnt have the recipe with me I was at someones house and I made it from memory but I forgot the condensed milk, didnt even miss it. It was wonderful both ways. The second time I also use reduced fat Nilla wafers and banana cream instant pudding mix. Thank you for the recipe, both times I've made it, it has been for guests or when I was a guest in someones home and I wanted to impress them."
"1","5","This was soooo yummy! I too used 3/4 of the sweetened cond. milk and one package of banana and one pkg. of vanilla pudding. I brushed the banana slices with a little lemon juice too and then sprinkled them with a little sugar to take the sour lemon flavor out. It was so easy tho. I brought it to work for someone's birthday and everyone loved it and it looks really nice layered in a bowl."
"1","5","Wonderful! The best banana pudding we've ever had. The whole family loved it."
"1","5","Very good....this is the only kind of banana pudding I will make from now on!"
"1","5","I THOUGHT THIS WAS WONDERFUL. I HAD ALWAYS USED THE STOVETOP METHOD BUT I AM VERY GLAD I FOUND THIS RECIPE. IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO WHIP THE CREAM CHEESE, I'D SUGGEST TO BRING IT TO ROOM TEMP. FIRST. AN OVERALL FAMILY FAVORITE!!"
"1","5","Fantastico!!! Loved it!!! Also used 1/2 banana pudding mix and vanilla pudding mix."
"1","5","I made this yesterday and was overall pleased. There will be a few changes the next time I make it, however. While everyone said it was very good, they also said it was too sweet and extremely rich. I will probably cut the sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese in half next time. I also used banana cream pudding instead, and had to improvise as far as the vanilla was concerned. I used coconut extract instead, seeing as how I didn't have vanilla on hand. I doubled the recipe and had a ton of it left over, but it DOES taste SOOOO much better the second day. I WILL make it again."
"1","5","Oh so good!! Great comfort food. I made this recipe and divided it into 3 small loaf sized pans to take to some of my friends who are new mothers and their families really enjoyed this bit of 'home cooking' too! My 4 year old, the original vanilla girl, even ate 2 helpings. I did substitue banana pudding mix for vanilla. A definite keeper. Thanks Patricia."
"1","5","Awesome. Southern Alabama cooks couldn't get enough and they're a tough crowd! substituted banana pudding mix, lemon-juiced the bananas to stay yellow, crushed remaining wafers and sprinkled that on top of whipped cream! beautiful presentation and gone in 60 seconds!"
"1","5","Really good stuff. I used a trifle bowl and ended up layering everything twice. I used two small boxes of vanilla pudding (couldn't find the size the recipe called for). I dipped the banana slices in lemon juice which kept them from browning, and also added a nice little 'bite' to a very sweet dessert. Next time I make this, I'm going to use two packages of cream cheese."
"1","5","tastes great & is so simple."
"1","5","This is the BEST banana pudding I have ever tasted!!!!"
"1","5","I am not a cook but I love banana pudding. This recipe was so easy and I got rave reviews. I did use banana cream pudding in place of the vanilla pudding. It was great!"
"1","5","I used 1 box of vanilla and one box of banana cream pudding and added another container of whipped cream. It was great, especially if you like more banana flavor."
"1","5","Very good! Even the baby was raving about this pudding! It's a tad sweet, maybe too much sweetened condenced milk? It was gone by the end of the day!"
"1","5","This was the best banana pudding I have ever had! My family loved it! I used banana pudding instead of vanilla, a whole box of vanilla wafers, and added the extra whipped cream to the mixture instead of on top. It was wonderful!!!!!"
"1","5","My family loved this recipe! I used the vanilla pudding as the recipe called for, but added about 2 tsps of banana cream pudding too and it tasted great! Plan on taking this to work potlucks since it is so easy to make! Thanks for the recipe."
"1","5","Made this for a group of 12. Most of it was gone before I could blink, and the kids loved it too."
"1","5","very very tasty and rich"
"1","5","best banana pudding I've ever made"
"1","5","Loved this receipe. It is rich and delicious. I will definately make this for a family/company gathering."
"0","5","Not only do I and my husband love this recipe but so does everyone! This is always a hit and I'm actually making it for a 'tailgate' get together with the family! I freaked out because I had lost my copy but thank goodness I found it on here again because I would be lost with out this amazing recipe!!! My go to for any occasion ! I always hear great compliments about it but it is all thanks to you for sharing it with us! Thank you!!!"
"0","5","After reading through many, many reviews, I opted to cut the milk to 2 cups when I made this. Usually the reviewers seem to be right on the money. This time...huge mistake! My pudding mixture set up like concrete and there was no moisture to soak into and soften my cookie layers! (I made this in two layers, putting a thin layer of pudding on the bottom; topping with a layer of Chessman cookies, then a layer of bananas; followed by another layer of pudding, cookies and bananas. Topped all with remaining whipped topping and crushed cookies.) The taste was delicious, but next time I will make it according to the original instructions. **Update -- after a few more hours, the cookie layers did soften and the taste and consistency was more like a very moist cake with a vanilla/banana filling. Everyone loved it!"
"0","5","THE PERFECT Banana Pudding in my eyes (and mouth)... Every time I make it its gobbled up before I can blink"
"0","5","I've made this recipe many times, and it turned out great... I've continued to use this recipe from here on out...  I love this recipe! ?"

"0","5","I get compliments every year when I make this for 4th of July!"
"0","5","I made this as written, didn't change anything and it was excellent!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious. Everyone I make it, it's gone the next day! The first time I made it exactly as written, and it was a tad softer than I like, so I now use 1/2c. less milk. I also tried it with chessmen cookies once, and prefer it that way. I dip the banana slices in lemon juice, so they don't turn brown. The first time I made it as written, and it had clumps of pudding, so I now beat the cream cheese to death, then mix the pudding and milk and separately and add to the cream cheese, along with the other ingredients. Great recipe - just needed a little tweaking for me. Oh, and I use the whole can of condensed milk. I mean, it's banana pudding, for crying out loud! It's supposed to be sweet."
"0","5","Made this over the weekend as per the exact recipe, no changes or additions. All I've got to say is this was absolutely AWESOME, DELICIOUS and everyone else thought the same after eating it."
"0","2","It was way to sweet for us."
"0","5","made exactly as recipe and this is a HOME RUN...this is a no fail recipe...Thanks so much"
"0","5","I was so confused by the reviews and changes, I followed the recipe as it said except I did 2 cups of milk, we were able to try it just an hour after making it. Very good! I will use this in the future."
"0","5","I made this recipe using the exact ingredients and amounts. However, I repeated the layers to distribute the ingredients throughout the pudding. It turned out beautifully. Can't wait to take this 'heavenly' dessert to a church social tomorrow."
"0","5","Wow. Let it sit overnight, spectacular. I like a dash of cinnamon in mine, personal preference. Great recipe."
"0","5","I make this at least 3 times a month and it's a huge hit in my home!"
"0","5","My son and I made this pudding following the recipe exactly. It was VERY tasty. The recipe size is the right amount for any potluck-If you are making it for a smaller family unit-split it into two dishes and take one to work."
"0","1","I think I did something wrong but unclear what. When I did this recipe, it never thickened and was runny. I know I used the correct amount of ingredients. But unsure if I did not correctly mix the cream cheese, milk, condensed milk, and pudding. It never thickened even after 24 hours. Instead of the 3 cups of milk, I used 2 cups of regular milk and 1 cup of lactoid milk. And I used a mixer.   So not sure what I did wrong. So my rating is not because it isn't a good recipe - it's in fact a great recipe but I must have missed something in the directions."
"0","5","I recently made for my family BBQ bash and this was awesome and extremely easy to make! I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","Delicious. I use two small boxes of white chocolate pudding."
"0","5","Made as written. I don't make desserts but my husband was craving banana cream anything. This is just like Mom made when I was growing up. Gotta love recipes from our past."
"0","5","very rich with the cream cheese addition. Too make the pudding not runny, add the cold milk SLOWLY whille mixing."

"0","5","Took to a church potluck and was gone in no time. Loved it!"
"0","5","my girlfriend fell in love with this recipe, and just a tip I added banana in the actual pudding mix and crumbled wafers on top"
"0","5","great summer frozen desert"
"0","5","No changes. OMG YUMMMY!!!!!!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly, which is the only way any recipe should be reviewed. This banana pudding is delicious. It is thick, rich and creamy. If you layer it in a 9x13 as the recipe says, you get pudding, cookies, bananas and whipped cream in every serving, every bite."
"0","2","Looks great, but I found this in the 'Egg-Free Recipes' section to make for someone with an egg allergy. Luckily I checked the ingredients of Vanilla Wafers, which are most decidedly *not* egg free. This recipe should **not** be called egg-free."
"0","5","Mmm...I loved I loved it...the only thing I added extra was a lil bit of chopped walnuts. It"
"0","5","This was great. Followed recipe exactly except I made the mistake of using ready whip from a can. It just ended up being a liquid mess on top, but underneath was wonderful!"
"0","4","This was my first time making banana pudding. It was really good, however, I did not know I needed to bring my cream cheese to room temp. I will try this next time, and the pudding seemed really thick. Also, I think I will add the bananas to each bow, so that it doesn't brown the bananas."
"0","4","This was really good. A little too sweet but still very good. I love this recipe!!!"
"0","4","GOOD Not great"
"0","5","very delicious?? I use I small box of French vanilla, banana cream pudding and half/half cream instead of whole milk to mixture. My Family love it!!"

"0","5","Did not change a thing on this absolutely wonderful recipe. It is a bit of work, but we'll worth it. Only problem is, my hubby will not stop asking me to make again and again..Thanks for such a great recipe!"
"0","5","I have been making this pudding for the last several months. I took the time to read through many reviews, but decided to make the recipe just as it was written the first time. It turned out fabulous and I don't feel like you need to make any adjustments. I always make sure the cream chees is at room temperature before I start. I cream it until it is fluffy and then again after I add the condensed milk. After those two are mixed, I add the milk straight from the fried, dump in the vanilla and add the pudding. I always get a little worried because it seems kind of runny, but once you FOLD in the whipped topping, it all starts to come together. I say this recipe is marvelous as it is. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","Always a hit! My family LOVES this recipe. We use banana pudding instead of vanilla."
"0","5","This is a excellent recipe and very easy to make the cream cheese gives it that extra kick"

I also added banana extract and vanilla extract. only used two cups of milk and 2 packs of another room..I LOVE IT SO MUCH.So good.. great recipe"
"0","5","This was delicious! Was is the key word because it's all gone!The only thing different; I couldn't find the size box of pudding listed in the recipe. I purchased 2 - 1.7 oz pkg. of instant vanilla pudding. You can see by my photo it came out perfect."
"0","5","Delicious! I made it just as written except with gluten free shortbread cookies. I can't deny that it is rich, but very yummy."
"0","5","I made this a few years ago when I first saw this recipe, and it was amazing! My mom loves Banana Pudding so I made it for her birthday and she said it was some of the best she ever had! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","Although this was a very simple recipe; I was a bit daunted by the fact that I've never made banana pudding before. But for my southern husband; this is a dessert staple! This recipe definitely lived up to the hype. I did however use vanilla and french vanilla pudding instead of the banana flavored pudding based on other reviews. Also, 'Nillas taste like scented cardboard to me so I swapped them out for the Pepperidge Farms Chessman cookies. Next time I would add a layer of crumbled cookies in the center. Yum!"
"0","5","Best one I've found so far"
"0","5","This Banana Pudding was the best ever!"
"0","5","I made it for my family for thanksgiving. I made my own whipped topping. Oh man it was the favorite of the feast. It also needed more banana."
"0","5","I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and must say it was a hit!! We had pumpkin rolls, turtle cupcakes, pumpkin pies, cookies, fruit cocktail, and a pecan pie.. But everyone was raving on how this was the BEST banana pudding ever!! I did NOT change a thing.. Although it does help to watch the video before you make!! All I can say is this is just been added to my recipe list!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us Patty!"
"0","5","It turned out great even though I forgot to put in the vanilla extract lol"
"0","5","I make this recipe all the time, but I use the fat free cool whip and condensed milk. I also use the reduced calorie vanilla wafers and vanilla instant pudding, and I use 1% milk.

"0","5","This is a fantastically creamy and decadent banana pudding! If you want a little more banana flavor, try making half the pudding with banana pudding mix and half with the vanilla. This was a huge hit with the family, and didn't even last 24 hours!"
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","4","Great potluck dish. Everyone loved it. Add more bananas. Goes a long way."
"0","5","I started making this for a birthday gathering to break the traditional cake thing. Started out making (2) 13x9 casserole pans, did that twice. Now that the word is out about how this dish taste I am being asked to make more. I have to make 7 this weekend for a Kairos gathering and a pastor appreciation gathering. It is a very good dish with no leftovers."
"0","5","Have made this recipe numerous times and is always a hit. I never have any left over."
"0","5","I love this recipe. I decided to layer it, but I made it exactly as posted."
"0","4","Well, if I had rated this after the first try, I would have given it five stars. But I have made it three times since, and each time I have ended up with little hunks of cream cheese that never blend it. I followed the recipe and instructions to the letter, including having the cream cheese at room temperature. The first time, it was as smooth as could be. The last three times, including tonight, I had little chunks of cream cheese that never blended in, no matter how long I beat the mixture, or at what speed. It still tastes fantastic, even with the lumps, but I sure wish I knew how to make the lumps go away!"
"0","3","Never made nor ate banana pudding before. But had to make it for a potluck. Personally I didn't love it. The nilla wafers got soggy. But the pudding mix itself tasted good"
"0","5","This is by far the best banana pudding I've ever had. My husbands co-workers ask me to make this for every function that involves food. I noticed, like other reviewers mentioned, that it was runny. Allow it to sit for about 3 minutes and it will begin to thicken. I was so disappointed when I first made it and noticed how runny it was. Thankfully I didn't throw it out. I left it sitting on the counter while I walked off to do something else and my husband noticed that it was thickening. Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","I made this for church, and dish came back empty. A full 9 x 13 dish! It was very good, and so easy to make. I will make again for sure."
"0","5","Yummy!!!"
"0","5","By far, the best!"
"0","1","Followed to a tea minus I put in 2 cups of milk instead of three and it was pure liquid! Made into smoothies but was sad it didn't make pudding. No idea what went wrong. :/"
"0","4","have prepared several times. twice it flopped and was more like soup than pudding. do not know if cream cheese was too cold and did not blend properly or what. when all ingredients blend smoothly it is fabulous!"
"0","5","This is fast and easy. It is so good. The first t that time I made was on Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I am going to make it for work tomorrow. I want to share this recipe"
"0","5","Holy heavenly pudding, Batman! It's absolutely awesome. First time I made it was by recipe to the letter. Amazing. Next time I made it, I pureed a very ripe banana and folded it into the pudding mixture. Un. Be. Lievable."
"0","5","My husband and I absolutely loved this! It was my first time attempting to make banana pudding and it was awesome and easy! Thanks for this!"
"0","3","The recipe is great, however I use 3 pkgs of Pepridge farm chessman cookies instead of vanilla wafers. I also use 2 small boxes of cheesecake instant pudding, instead of vanilla. I also fold in some extra creamy whipped topping once the mixture is combined together, before layering the pudding & cookies. Its taste great. My fiance likes strawberries on one side & bananas on the other. People beg me to bring this every where I go. They also try to pay me to make it for their events. I just give them the recipe. I have professional chefs that use the recipe now. I love it."
"0","3","I love banana pudding and I made this one based on the reviews. I made it following the recipe exactly and it was extremely sweet and i like sweet but this was over kill. I ended up scraping off the top layer of whip cream and adding more bananas just so my family would eat it."
"0","5","Excellent, big hit at the July 4th party! I mixed pudding base, bananas and cookies in big glass bowl, then covered top with a bit of whipped cream and crushed cookie with cookies all round edge."
"0","5","I took this to a 4th of July BBQ! It was a HIT! Very very Good!! I had no vanilla wafers on hand so what i did was lined my pan with sliced twinkines!! TO DIE FOR!!"
"0","5","I do not cook. However, am always looking for easy recipes for family, friends, and church. I've made this recipe at least six times and it's always a big hit at every group function! I have changed the recipe a little in using less condensed milk and adding more bananas. Everyone looks for it at our church cookouts. That's pretty awesome for this 'UnChef'."
"0","5","Excellent recipe, have made several times exactly as written and it was awesome.But last time we whipped peanut butter into the cool whip and it was AMAZING!"
"0","1","I followed the recipe to the T. It came out way to sweet and to watery. I did use the chessman cookies and made sure the cream cheese was room temp."
"0","5","I've made this recipe for 12 servings and I've made it for 250. It never fails to be a crowd pleaser and is one recipe that I never change from the original. It's absolutely perfect and possibly the best banana pudding I've ever had."
"0","5","Everyone raved about this banana pudding."
"0","5","Amazing! I love banana pudding and this is the best I've ever had!"
"0","5","You will never make another banana pudding recipe after making this one! I get tons of requests for the recipe every time I make it. The only thing I do differently is substitute the vanilla wafers with Pepperidge Farms Chessmen cookies like another reader posted If you follow the recipe like it's written, you can't go wrong."
"0","5","This is a great recipe! The only changes I make are substituting a cup of whipped topping for one of the cups of milk, and extra vanilla wafers as I like them more than the bananas."
"0","5","This is seriously the BEST banana pudding I have ever made. I ran short of whole milk so I only used about 2 1/2 cups but it came out just fine. As another reviewer mentioned, it is imperative that the cream cheese is room temp and is properly whipped before adding any more ingredients. I added the cool whip when it was still partially frozen, the milk was very cold, and I used the amount of pudding mix recommended; the pudding began setting up within minutes of mixing. I ended using an 8x8 because I couldn't find my casserole dish, it was a blessing in disguise. I didn't have enough room for a cool whip topping layer and it didn't need it. It is sweet enough without it so I just put sliced banana and crushed nilla wafers on top. DELISH!! I will be making this from now on as my 'go-to' dessert in the summer!"
"0","4","Very good an easy."
"0","5","I made this for Easter today. It was delicious! I actually like the wafers when they are crunchier so I didn't let it sit in the fridge overnight. It was only in there for about 45 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it! Even my husband who would never pick pudding as a dessert to eat. I will definitely make it again!"
"0","5","This was awesome.My very first attempt to make banana pudding and it turned out perfect.All the family loved it and had seconds.It was so simple to prepare and I didn't change or add anything extra.Thanks Patty for an awesome and super quick recipe."
"0","5","I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great! It was really easy and oh so yummy."
"0","3","good"
"0","5","Great!"
"0","1","I made this and it was way to runny. To much milk!"
"0","4","instead of all vanilla pudding, I used have vanilla & half banana cream. I also used home made whipped cream."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful."
"0","5","Loved it!!!!"
"0","5","This is so creamy and delishious. I thought it was easy too."
"0","2","It was awfully sweet! Need to cut down the amount of condense milk for sure."
"0","5","This came out absolutely decadent! I made a few minor adjustments: I used reduce fat wafers, light cool whip, and two 3.4 ounces of vanilla instant pudding. Unlike other reviewers, I kept the full can of condense milk and I stayed away from banana cream pudding (I hate artfical banana flavor anything). Next time, I will try this with lite cream cheese. This will now be my go to dessert for any occasion!"
"0","5","Made this for Super Bowl. Followed recipe exactly. Super yummy. I did use fat free cream cheese and light cool whip and skim milk. Still rich and good."
"0","4","This was a big hit at a party I attended. Everyone loved it. Great for crowds. I think the 12 serving size is very generous as I fed about 20-25 with it. I used DazzlinDarlene's suggestions. I think it would be nearly impossible to mess this up."
"0","5","I thought this was amazing. I didn't like how the wafers got soggy though and the bananas turned brown the next day. I'm making it again and will put the bananas in lemon juice and eliminate the wafers altogether. I may try something crunchier on top like crushed almonds or granola."
"0","5","This is a great recipe. I love sweets but found this to be extremely sweet. I will take the advise of another commenter and half the condensed milk next time. Also used 1 vanilla and 1 banana for the pudding."
"0","5","Followed as is. Very tasty recipe."
"0","5","Quick and easy dessert, I used Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies instead of wafers and it was delicious!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe as is and it was great. Very nice creamy texture and flavor. The pudding held up very well. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","Delish. Make it the night before. Is better after sitting overnight. Also make sure once all the milk is added that you beat it for a good 3-5 minutes."
"0","5","I substituted real whipped cream for the cool whip and layered the pudding mixture, whipped cream, cookies and bananas in a trifle dish. So delicious!"
"0","5","We made this for Christmas dessert and everybody loved it. We have been making this for years."
"0","5","I really enjoyed this. It was a hit for Christmas desert. And my man loved it!! We used a blender to give the pudding more consistency with the texture n it made it easier to pour in the baking dish"
"0","4","Really great recipe... Simple and easy to make. I really don't care for the bananas in my pudding so instead of vanilla mix I used banana cream to get the banana flavor. I also used half a can of the condensed milk... Great add ins are chocolate or nuts. Will definitely make again"
"0","5","I always double this recipe. I used 4 small boxes of instant Jello pudding of my choice. Combinations include Vanilla, French Vanilla, Cheesecake, White Chocolate, or Banana cream.I use the entire half gallon of milk cause all the puddings tend to get thick. Been using this recipe for about ten years now. It is a request for me to make. People think this is my own personal recipe that I made up. I have to tell them the truth. I got this recipe off ALLRECIPES.COM"
"0","5","I followed recipe exactly and it was one of the best if not THE best we have all ever had as banana pudding lovers. Reading the reviews is super helpful when looking for modifications to better your recipe or if you want to try the recipe."
"0","5","Excellent!"
"0","5","Huge hit at my house everyone loved this"
"0","5","This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Thanks for posting it!"
"0","3","My son loves banana pudding! He said this was the best he has ever eaten. I used the french vanilla pudding because I didn't have the other. It was good but not the best I have had!"
"0","5","This is truly the best recipe I've found. The only thing I did was make the whipped cream rather than use store bought. Can you say empty bowls every time? This is the only recipe I will use from now on...thanks!"
"0","5","My family devoured it!"
"0","5","awesome recipe, my family loved it. My dish was finished 5 minutes after setting it out. :)"
"0","5","Our family loves this recipe!! We take this to social events all the time and always a huge hit. I've been making it for years and the recipe is perfect no need for alterations! Sometimes I sprinkle slivered almonds on the top, delicious!"
"0","5","This is fantastic! I followed the directions exactly, and I was slightly worried because the mixture was soupy. After a few minutes it thickened up quite a bit! I beat the cream cheese while it was cold (don't know why so many reviews say to leave it out to room temp first), added everything in the order it was written (although next time I may not add the milk last because it made kind of a sloshy mess even with the mixer on low speed haha), and it turned out the way it was supposed it. I used mini Nilla Wafers instead of the regular ones, and I got three layers of everything into a 4 quart Pyrex glass bowl. This is definitely my new go-to recipe. :)"
"0","3","Hi all. I made this recipe for my family for the first time and mine was very liquidity? I was wondering why? I followed the ingredients as well as the instruction. I have trouble making this delicious dessert? Please leave any comments and suggestions, so I can make it better. Thank you."
"0","4","I made the recipe exact and thought 14oz of sweetened condensed milk made it too sweet, think I would try half. I lined the 9 x 13 pan with an entire box of Vanilla Wafers & up the sides. It was devoured!"
"0","5","Great!!! This dish is always a winner. Lessons learned: Make sure you pick up Jello INSTANT pudding and NOT 'cool & serve' etc. Your pudding will be runny and lack a thick consistency. I use 1 3.5oz of French vanilla instant and 1 3.5oz of vanilla, Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies and 2-3 more bananas....YUMMY! Also I cover the top of the dish with additional cookies and not whipped cream..."
"0","1","This recipe should not be in the egg free section as Vanilla wafer Cookies have eggs in them. At least all the ones I have ever seen do. I have an allergy to eggs and become very sick I would hate for someone else to make it not knowing that and get sick or make it for someone else that has an allergy and have them get sick."
"0","3","It was all right but didn't get finished off."
"0","1","I did everything in the recipe and it came out really soupy...but the mix tastes pretty good!"
"0","5","Very very good! Everyone raved . I will be making again for sure!!"
"0","1","Mine didn't set at all after 7 hours in the fridge.... Disgusting soup was the result."
"0","5","Loved it! I followed the recipe exactly how it is. The only thing I did diff was sprinkled a dash of cinnamon sugar on top! Delicious!"
"0","5","LOVE THIS!!! Will make you into a banana pudding believer! HOWEVER:  -cut the condensed milk in half. trust. -use sugar-free pudding mix. I used one bag on 3.5 oz banana pudding mix and one bag of 3.5 oz cheesecake pudding mix. if you do this, play around with the proportions of the condensed milk and add to your liking.  -instead of using vanilla wafers, use the chessmen cookies (makes all the difference!). *if it is too lumpy, use a hand-beater and it will be smooooth!"
"0","5","Excellent!! Made it for my husband for his birthday and he was practically licking his bowl before I even had a spoon in mine. My mother told me it was the best banana pudding she ever had!! I followed the recipe exactly as it calls for. Thanks Patty!!"
"0","5","I put in only 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, only because I couldn't find my 1 tsp measuring spoon! It was good otherwise. I was a little worried that the condensed milk would have made it too sweet but it was just right."
"0","5","I loved it and the rest of the family! At first I hated it because I made the mistake of not adding the 'INSTANT' pudding mix! It was just the regular pudding mix that you have to cook to thicken it! So when I saw that was just a watery mix I got to think why if I done everything right! Si I check the box of the pudding and it was the 'Cook and Serve box' and not the 'Instant' pudding box! If you are making it make sure u use the right pudding mix! ;)"
"0","3","I couldn't find 5 oz pudding so I used two 3.4 oz instead. To save on calories, I used lower fat cream cheese, lite whipped topping, fat free condensed milk and skim milk. I needed way more than half the vanilla wafers to fill the 9 x 13. This is way too sweet. There was none of this left, but I think the sweetened condensed milk makes this a sweet mess."
"0","5","Yum-O-Rama!!! Made as written and it was Awesome I think getting the milk ice cold by putting it in the freezer for a bit was the key... Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Very rich! Awesome flavor and texture."
"0","5","I've made this a few times & each time it's GREAT! I'm a non-cooker so if you cook you'll really find this quick and easy. Watching the video helped a lot. It's one of my staples. Family loves it! Try it; you'll love it. Thanks Patty!"
"0","5","This is an AWESome recipe! Quick and delicious. I did have trouble getting it to thicken up ......so I used 2 small packages of vanilla instant pudding instead of one. Yummy!!!"
"0","4","It's very good but incredibly rich. I think next time I make it, I'll cut the cream cheese to 3/4 instead of a whole brick. Ill also add about a 1/4 cup more milk."
"0","5","Made just as the recipe instructed. Hubby & kids absolutely loved it. So, I made some for a potluck at work and it was a big hit! Delicious, simple, and great for sharing! Thanks so much for posting this recipe. I'm actually making it again tomorrow!"
"0","5","This was just fantastic. A bit more time to fix but worth the extra few minutes from my conventional banana pudding. Definitely a keeper!!"
"0","5","This is the 4th time I've made this. First time - I didn't have vanilla (it still tasted great - not the end of the world without vanilla) 4.5 stars. 2nd time - I had the bright idea of making it with everything low fat / fat free (it had a strange taste and I DON'T recommend it) 3rd and 4th time, made it 'NORMAL' full fat everything and exactly as the recipe says and it was perfecto! Reminds me of a rich vanilla ice cream had a baby with creme brulee, with bonus banana deliciousness... Side note: I used a hand held mixer (life saver) my cream cheese was still cold (no bid deal), and yes the pudding was slightly runny - I even thought I accidentally put too much milk - BUT it set up nicely in the fridge. This is my go do dessert! and Everyone raves about it. enjoy!"
"0","5","Love this - everyone asks me to make it! I do add more wafers and banana than it calls for, but everything else I do exactly as the recipe states. love it!!!"
"0","5","I make fresh whipped cream myself instead of using store bought stuff, and I have never had anyone not ask for a large second helping. Its funny how many people are coincidentally 'in the area' when they hear I'm making it. It puts my grandmother's to shame!"
"0","5","Made this recipe for a graduation party a few days ago and it turned out really good. Everyone really seemed to like it and it disappeared pretty quickly. Really rich and creamy banana flavor, only thing I did diffrent was I added more cool whip and vanilla wafers."
"0","5","Have made this multiple times! When I take it to a potluck there are never any leftovers! I make it exactly as written and it comes out perfect. The last 2 times I just had two little boxes of pudding on hand instead of one big box-works! As many reviewers have pointed out, make sure your cream cheese is room temp! Also cream the cream cheese and condensed milk together before adding other ingredients. I also use skim milk. If it appears to runny just beat it longer! I serve it in a trifle bowl with 2 layers of nilla wafers and bananas."
"0","3","Just ok. A little too sweet for my liking (and my family's)."
"0","5","This is a total crowd pleaser. Everyone licks the pan clean!"
"0","5","This is FANTASTIC! Since my grandmother has passed I haven't had a good banana pudding, there was just something special about hers. I have finally found one she would have been proud of! I made this last night in preparation for my 2 girls graduation party today..I did make a few changes, only due to my diet (watching my sugar intake). I used sugar free vanilla instant pudding, and sugar free cool whip. Since I had cut down on much of the sugar I went ahead and used the full can of sweetened condensed milk, and I only used 2 cups milk also..My pudding was thick and luscious...this is an amazing recipe, thanks for sharing it!!!!"
"0","5","I made this last night and my husband and son loved it! Instead of using 3 cups of milk I used 2 cups but it turned out great....definietly will make it again, Thank you.."
"0","5","This has been a huge favorite at events. I have had people drive across the city just for another taste. I used a couple suggestions from other post to kick it up a notch. I added nutmeg and cinnamon. added a layer of wafers and fruit to the bottom and middle. I used half vanilla half banana cream pudding. I used extra rich whipped topping. I added fruit and crumbs to the top right before serving. I've also substituted the bananas with strawberries a couple of times due to family allergies."
"0","5","I used this recipe for a Christmas dish and it was DELICIOUS. Everybody loved it."
"0","5","Absolutely amazing. First time making banana pudding and it turned out perfect. While I was making the pudding I noticed that the 2 vanilla pudding boxes I had were actually different ounces even though the size of the boxes were the same. I think that's what lead to some having soupy pudding. I ended up measuring out the pudding on a scale to I would have the correct about. When I was finished it turned out perfect. A must try!"
"0","5","I read some of the reviews that have you change this and that.....this recipe doesn't need any tweaking (seems like someone already took a lot of time tweaking it for you).... don't screw it up if you want the best banana pudding you have ever had just go by the recipe."
"0","5","The best banana pudding I have ever had,no joke!This was gone in a day,family could not stop eating it."
"0","5","I tried the recipe and i love the taste but it was too runny. i think i will use the 2 cups next time but what i want to know is when you say you cut the milk down to 2 cups, do you still use the 5oz pudding pack or do you use one 3oz package which calls for 2 cups of milk? Thanks"
"0","5","love it !"
"0","5","One of the best banana puddings ever! I actually used more bananas than the recipe suggested but I think it mixed well with the pudding so everything turned out quite yummy!"
"0","5","I made this before, it is so good. The only thing I do differently is I use strawberry cream cheese."
"0","5","YUM YUM YUM!!! Made this for Easter, and it was definitely a hit! I've never used condensed milk or cream cheese before, but it turned out wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly aside from using banana pudding instead of the vanilla. This will be made regularly because of how much everyone like it."
"0","4","Pros: Great taste. Cons: Won't set. The pudding wasn't quite consistent enough largely because the recipe simply has too much milk. For first time cooking, you'll want to scale the milk down or add in another pudding mix to get a thicker texture. This is especially true if you make whipped cream instead of using a tub of whipped topping.  I felt that the banana flavor was consistent enough after letting it set overnight to the point where banana pudding mix would be unnecessary. Your mileage may vary. Enjoy!"
"0","4","OH MY! Banana pudding brings back so many childhood memories. My mom would make her puddind from scratch, that was the only way banana pudding was made in my house and that was the only way I enjoyed it. Intill I made this receipe, this is really delicious. I have to share it with my mom she is going to love this. THank's for helping me created new memories for my family."
"0","5","We followed this recipe exactly as written. It was awesome and this will be the way we always make it! Just a tip-you can put some lemon juice on the sliced bananas before adding them to keep them from turning brown. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","Great!"
"0","5","Great pudding recipe, very heavy and sweet but very good"
"0","5","It was excellent. I had to make mine with the golden Double stuff oreos though because I didn't have vanilla wafers and the store was closed. Awesome!"
"0","5","Really good! Needed a quick and easy banana pudding recipe and this was perfect. Our new family recipe"
"0","5","Delicious! Didn't even use the whip cream and it was amazing!"
"0","5","This was perfect and my family loved it"
"0","4","a little too sweet for me. I would cut back on sugars next time. but then again i'm not into really sweet things so it might be perfect for you."
"0","5","This recipe is delicious and EASY. My 11 year old makes this all on her own to bring to parties and family gatherings. It's always a hit!"
"0","5","I had never made banana pudding before, and was surprised that it didn't have banana pudding in it! I was asked to make this for a funeral dinner and found this recipe. Several tried and true Southern ladies said that it was the best they'd ever had! I'll take it. The recipe is delicious."
"0","5","Delicious yet I think it was a bit too sweet for our test. Will reduce condensed milk to half next time."
"0","5","I think this was a very good pudding. I made it today and it went over extremely well. I added pecans with the bananas just to give a little something to it. Thank you for the recipe."
"0","5","I had to make a few changes because I was whipping this together last minute so was using what I had on hand - used graham crackers to line the bottom of 13x9 pan instead of vanilla wafers and only had the smaller (4 serving) vanilla pudding mix so used less milk, about 2 1/2 cups. Also mixed the whole tub of cool whip into the mixture rather than putting it on the top. The was a complete hit with my family!"
"0","5","It's a great thing when all of your guests want seconds on dessert. This was fantastic! I made it with real whipped cream instead of cool whip... AMAZING!"
"0","5","This pudding is the bomb didn't and wouldn't change a think"
"0","5","Everytime I make this recipe I get huge raves. I use Pepperidge Farms Bordeaux cookies instead of vanilla wafers, Instant Banana Pudding instead of Vanilla and I always use non-fat milk.   A reviewer said her pudding didn't set - make sure to use the larger box of INSTANT pudding and beat for at least 2-3 minutes.  I usually don't cover in the extra coolwhip as I'm not a fan. I use fresh whipped cream."
"0","5","Made this just last night for a home group and followed directions as written. I sprinkled just a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon on it before I put the last 1/2 whip cream on it. BIG hit! Will make again definitely!"
"0","5","UNBELIEVABLY tasty!! Will definitely add this to my usual go-to recipes! Super simply and delicious. Even better the 2nd or 3rd day--if it lasts that long! I would suggest putting a bit of lemon juice on the bananas to stop the browning, and definitely make sure the cream cheese is room temp. I used 1/2 can of condensed milk as per other reviews....was perfect. May have been too sweet with a whole can."
"0","5","Each & Every time I make this I receive compliments, and with little to no leftovers. The pudding sets up nice and firm, so it holds it shape as guest get a serving out of the dish. Other recipes would be runny... not this one, very pretty and taste great! Have now made it approx 10 times."
"0","5","I made this for my family for a party. They all raved about it and said it was by far the best thing I have ever made. It was absolutely delicious.....A KEEPER!! I will make this again and again."
"0","1","mine came out watery i dont know why"
"0","5","Like banana cream pie, but at a fraction of the effort. Wonderful! I used chessmen instead of vanilla wafers to make a top and bottom crust. It sat overnight because the kids unexpectedly slept through the night and it's perfect."
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding EVER!!!!!"
"0","5","I made this for Christmas Family Desert, We decided on something different than the same as always. My family Love it, they love it so much I'm asks to make some more for them this weekend."
"0","5","Made exactly as called. Delizioso!"
"0","5","I made this pudding yesterday to take to hospitality today after our Christian meeting today hoping that it would turn out well, and guess what? It did!! Everyone loved it! I think the cream cheese and condensed milk took it to a whole new level. I used a large pkgs.(6 1/2oz.) of vanilla pudding and it was just what it needed. The pudding will seem a little running at first, but don't worry it will thicken up shortly. EXCELLENT banana pudding. I already have request for more."
"0","5","Amazing. I use Chessman cookies instead of the traditional vanilla wafers for a little twist."
"0","5","I make this EXACTLY as recipe says to. NO problems and is way delicious! Everyone eats it up. Thank you for sharing."
"0","5","Awesome! I am a complete chocoholic but this may have become my new favorite dessert! Took to a New Years Eve party and everyone loved it!!! I doubled the recipe, used 3 of the smaller boxes of french vanilla pudding mix, and only used 1 8oz container cool whip. I layered the wafers, bananas and pudding mix in a trifle bowl -3 to 4 layers, ending with the pudding. Topped each serving with more cool whip. I could only fit about 3/4 in the trifle bowl, kept the remaining pudding mix at home to enjoy later (without the wafers or bananas - add those later as you serve it or bananas will go bad). You have to try this!"
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe. I made it at Christmas for about  20 people so I doubled the recipe because I knew a few people would want to take some home. The only changes I  made was I layered the nilla wafers, then bananas, then pudding & I repeated this until all the pudding was used.  I also didn't put the cool whip on top. Other than that I  followed this recipe & will definitely make it again!!"
"0","5","We enjoyed this very much. I followed this recipe exactly."
"0","5","BEST banana pudding ever ! and so easy to make . I had about 20 people over for Christmas dinner and everybody loved it"
"0","5","I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Everyone has requested it for Christmas, birthdays and any day we get together. Not sure why anyone would change anything with this. It was perfect and I made it exactly like it shows above."
"0","5","Delicious! This was really good. A tasty variation of the 'traditional' banana pudding my mom made."
"0","5","I've made this recipe for the past two Holiday get togethers with my family and each time it gets great compliments. Not to mention requests to make it again. I made no changes at all in the recipe. Made it just as described. I hope that is helpful for some of you out there wondering if the unaltered version is good."
"0","5","I made this for a party and there was nothing left. I was amazing. Everyone loved the taste of it. I did use french vanilla pudding though."
"0","5","some of the best banana pudding i have ever had. no fake banana taste. loved by all at my daughters birthday, and all moms asked for the recipe"
"0","5","best banana pudding ever!!! perfect amt of everything"
"0","5","I am glad we tried it."
"0","5","I followed some of the suggestions (2 cups of milk instead of 3, 1 sm French Vanilla and Banana Cream instant pudding) and it turned out great. This recipe will be a favorite at home in no time. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","I followed the advice of another reviewer...I used Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies in lieu of the Nilla wafers. I used only 2 cups milk to mix into the instant pudding. I beat the pudding & milk with a mixer, then beat the cream cheese with the condensed milk separately, stirred the cool whip into the cheese mixture, and added that to the instant pudding. I used 8 bananas to fill a 13 x 9 aluminum pan. The pudding set up perfectly. The bananas darkened after we cut into it, but they tasted just as good the second day."
"0","5","This banana pudding is awesome and so easy to make. I made it just like the recipes says minus 1 cup of milk. I also saw the video which is very helpful, I wasn't sure how to add the cool whip. Everybody liked it at my job and now I'm taking it to a church reunion where about 80 people are going, I'm taking three trays, I hope its enough!"
"0","5","Very sweet, but Delish !!"
"0","5","I will never make banana pudding another way ever again. This is so decadent and delicious. Double the recipe! I promise you you will need to! It is usually the first thing to go at gatherings :) Thank you soooo much to the poster! This dessert makes you look fab with hardly any effort."
"0","5","I have made this recipe multiple times and everyone says it's the best 'Southern Style' banana pudding they have ever eaten. I do get the larger size Cool Whip as I like more on the top. I make this in my Granny's large round glass bowl so I do get multiple layers of wafers, bananas & pudding, but I follow the recipe as is."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, I just finished off a bowl of this. I followed this recipe exactly as stated, but I had to use two 3.4 oz packs instead of 1 5 oz. I was a little skeptical about adding the whipped topping at the end because my fiance' doesn't like whipped topping, but he absolutely enjoyed it. He said it was good and rich. I made it this morning so it could set a little. Was initially going to wait and have it for dinner, but couldn't resist so I just had it. I am amazed at the amount. This recipe gives you a decent amount. If you have a crowd larger than 6, I could definitely see doubling this recipe. I did not think it was too sweet or not sweet enough. This recipe is just right. I am a beginner in the kitchen so I appreciate great recipes. Thank you for sharing this. You cannot go wrong with this one, it is simply divine! Oh, as others stated, let the cream cheese be room temp before mixing."
"0","5","This receipe is absolutely wonderful!! I have fell in love; not to mention, my kids truly enjoyed this version of the classic banana pudding!"
"0","5","We go to a local BBQ restaurant mostly for their fresh banana pudding. This one is BETTER than that. I have been craving it and have made it 4 times in the past 2 weeks. It HAS to be instant pudding! Absolutely LOVE this recipe - all 8 of us!!!"
"0","5","Tasted great and was easy to make."
"0","3","I had to cut back on the sweetened condensed milk. Using all of it makes it way too sweet !! I like to also make it with my own whipped cream. You would be surprised at the difference in it !! With that said its a keeper but gotta have those changes !"
"0","5","I made this recipe for a bible study and was worried since I had never tried it before. I did make a few changes. I used one 3.4oz box of Vanilla instant and one of Banana instant pudding and I used the entire tub of whipped topping in the pudding mixture. I used a clear bowl and layered the wafers, bananas and pudding. Looked GREAT!! Everyone LOVED it and wanted more. I have been asked to make it again three different times. Great recipe!!!"
"0","5","I make this all the time for my family. In fact, just made one for Thanksgiving! Can't wait to dig in to it. I use 3 to 4 banana's depending on how many I can get layered on the bottom! This is an awesome recipe!"
"0","5","It was so easy to make and my family loved it!! It was gone in a few hours... Will make again"
"0","5","This is a keeper. I used Pepperidge Farm Chess Cookies and real whipped cream with a bit of powder sugar to sweeten instead of the whipped topping. Everyone raves about it - simple to make but a real crowd pleaser."
"0","5","This banana pudding is phenomenal. I make it every year for holiday gatherings and often upon requests from friends. Good stuff!"
"0","1","There is no such thing as a 5 oz pkg of pudding. I bought one pudding mix at the sore which was '.8' oz. so when I looked at this soupy mess I added another box of pudding, same size, to see if it would thicken it. Added all the milks and pudding at one time per the directions, and now have little globs of cream cheese in this mess. Another similar recipe had directions which would probably have worked better, having you add each milk gradually and incorporating into the whipped cream cheese before adding more."
"0","5","loved this pudding i didnt use the whip cream and i used regular canned milk.i made the pudding first then added the other ingredients so it wouldnt come out watery"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","well, the recipe was delicious. the problem i had was, as soon as i started to pour the liquid into the pan my 'nilla wafers floated, & got mixed, & messy. tasted greated just made a poor presentaion"
"0","5","This recipe is wonderful! I always get compliments! My husband brought it to work for a BBQ/Picnic & people were asking for the recipe! The only changes I made were that I doubled the amount of whipped topping & vanilla wafers. I made two layers of cookies instead of just one as the recipe states. This recipe can also be made low-fat using reduced-fat or fat-free cream cheese, fat-free sweetened condensed milk, skim milk, fat-free Cool Whip, and reduced-fat Vanilla Wafers. One tip...make sure you bring the cream cheese to nearly room temperature, or it won't blend right when you beat it."
"0","5","Amazing!! (:"
"0","5","Amazing...was hard to not just eat the pudding mixture!"
"0","5","This is the best recipe! Everybody loves it! One of the best! :)"
"0","4","This was very good! Make sure you let it chill in refrig though, the longer it sits the more you can taste the bananas.I will make this again."
"0","5","This recipe is AMAZING! I did what a lot of the other reviewers recommended and only used 2 cups of COLD milk. I also mixed the instant pudding (half vanilla half banana) and milk first and added CARMEL instead of the Vanilla Extract. I then in a separate bowl mixed the cream cheese and condensed milk whipping both bowls very well. I think added them together and whipped really well- then stirred in the whipped topping (I used extra creamy whipped topping). I also substituted vanilla wafers with Chessman cookies. It came out AMAZING! Better than my mothers. Thank you so much for this recipe."
"0","5","omg this is a great recipe i made it exactly as listed the first time . the second time i made it i layered it and also added strawberry pie filling in themiddle n topped it off with toasted coconut.. but i must say this recipe is great im gonna make this more often"
"0","5","The best banana pudding I have ever had!"
"0","4","the office girls loved it"
"0","5","Simply AWESOME!!!"
"0","5","AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! This is my first time making Banana Pudding so I wanted it to be the best. My 'want' became a reality. The cream cheese had me wondering but it blended very well. I didn't need as many bananas because I used big bananas and I used more wafers. Everybody loved it and so did I. Certainly a keeper. Thank you!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious. Thie recipie is a keeper. I have made this several times and it doesn't last 24 hours!"
"0","5","I make ZERO changes to this recipe. well.. ok .. on occasion I have used 'french' vanilla pudding instead of the vanilla pudding, but I hardly think that counts. :D I've been making it year after year and my family gobbles it up and wonders where MORE is? :D Its simple & delicious!"
"0","5","AMAZING!! There is a bakery that was a couple of towns over that i would travel to in order to get the Vanilla pudding. They closed the one near me and now i would have to drive about 45 minutes to their other bakery. This tastes almost EXACTLY like the pudding they had but my honey thinks this one is BETTER!! I love it!! I made it last week and im making it again tonight!"
"0","5","delicious--used half can of condensed milk otherwise it might be to sweet--DO NOT use banana flavored pudding unless you love that very artificial banana taste. tried it once and it ruined the whole thing. it was all you could taste."
"0","5","I made this tonight at a family get together , it turned out great! everyone loved it and wanted the recipe, thanks for the great recipe"
"0","5","Awesome Awesome Awesome! Loved it Kids loved it Hubby loved it. Easy to make simple ingredients.  Will make a lot."
"0","5","My teenage son's new favorite!"
"0","5","Wow! Made this for a church picnic and it was a big hit. I added a layer of strawberries between the pudding and whipped cream. Will make this again for sure!"
"0","3","awfully sweet."
"0","5","Delicious!"
"0","5","This dessert is REALLY GOOD!"
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding. My family loves it!! I followed CESPIRITU suggestions and have to say it was amazing!"
"0","4","This banana pudding recipe was good but a bit too sweet for my husband and me. I think I would cut down a little bit of the sweetness the next time I make this."
"0","5","This is awesome! I use 1/2 the can of condensed milk and light cream cheese to shave off some of the calories. It tastes even better the 2nd day."
"0","5","My daughter and I made this and it was fabulous. We even made another dish for our neighbors. I liked the recipe just the way it was written. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","If I could, I would give it 10 stars. Best Banana Pudding Ever!"
"0","5","Wonderfully rich and delicious."
"0","5","5 stars"
"0","4","Very easy to make and yummy. It is super sweet though."
"0","5","I followed this recipe as is ~ Omgosh....so good! There was none left at the get together I was at."
"0","5","Delicious. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","I love this recipe! I'm not a great cook and this was VERY simple to make. My family and others were quite proud of me with this recipe. It's a definite keeper. Thank you!!!"
"0","5","I have made this banana pudding for quite a few family and church gatherings, and it always gets rave reviews! It's my dad's favorite dessert, and I love that! :)"
"0","5","i made your banana pudding, which was the first time i ever made it, and people loved it! they asked for the recipe and everything! lol thanks"
"0","5","This was good. I had 2 bananas I had to use up and an old graham cracker crust, so I halved recipe and poured it into the pie crust. Nice and light with a pleasant subtle banana undertone. We enjoyed. UPDATING: Increased to a 5. I can't remember the last time MOTH & I ate an entire pie ... usually 1/2 of it ends up being trashed a few days later. We devoured this one - time def improves flavors."
"0","5","This was so easy to make! I didn't change a thing. Everyone LOVED it. I will make this again."
"0","5","I made this earlier today and served it tonight. Everyone that tried it went back for seconds :) It's a keeper!"
"0","5","this gives banana pudding a whole new consistincey. Its so rich creamy and delish."
"0","5","Love this!!!!! Took it to work for a July 4th potluck. ( nurses like to celebrate too!) I used a small box of banana pudding and a small box of french vanilla pudding as suggested by others and left the amount of milk the same. I even used store brand ingredients to save $ and it was still super good! Best when made the night before so the cookies can soak up the flavors."
"0","5","Absolutely WONDERFUL! I bought the 3.4 oz box of vanilla pudding accidentally so I reduced the milk to two cups and it came out fabulous. I only had skim milk on hand and it still came out thick and creamy. I can't wait to share this at the next work party!"
"0","4","Pretty good recipe. The only change I made was using 2 cups of milk as others stated intead of 3 cups. The kids and hubby raved about it but I personally thought It was too sweet for me. Will I make this again???yes... If my family enjoyed it there is always a posibility I'll make it again. :)"
"0","5","Very good. This is my new favorite banana pudding recipe."
"0","5","Everyone loves and raves about this banana pudding. I have shared the recipe many times."
"0","4","I'm giving this a '4' because I modified it... after mixing the first 5 ingredients, i didn't really think the consistency was thick enough, so I added a 1.5 oz box of french vanilla pudding and also used a 16oz tub of cool whip instead of just an 8oz. I used 1/2 of the cool whip to mix into the pudding mixture and then used the other half to layer: cookies, banana's, pudding, coolwhip. I had enough for 2 layers of each. YUMMMMM! It was soooo good!!!"
"0","5","This was wonderful!! Made it for Father's Day and will make it again for the 4th of July. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!"
"0","5","Love this. My husband thinks he is a banana pudding expert and he loves it. I didn't read the full vanilla pudding ingredient part though and used banana, I have made it both ways and both taste just as good. It just depends if you want an extra banana taste I guess."
"0","5","excellent! I decreased the milk to approx. 2 cups. This was the first thing to go at a potluck!"
"0","5","This was sooooo good!!! And so easy... Everyone wanted recipe!"
"0","5","OMG, this was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly and it was sooo good. It is now my go to banana pudding recipe."
"0","5","The pudding alone in this is fantastic. I hate bananas, but I decided to make this for father's day. Tasting the cream cheese in the pudding is great. No point to make instant anymore when this is just as easy and so much better."
"0","5","very good"
"0","5","This is my family's favorite banana pudding by far. I make it exactly how the recipe says, it's perfect!"
"0","5","This Banana pudding recipe is by far the best I have found. Makes a yummy, creamy pudding. It's so easy to make and everyone loves it!"
"0","5","Very good! My family and friends loved it!"
"0","5","So good! Taste just like banana pudding you'd order in a down home, mom & pops southern restaurant. I'm a southern girl, so I know banana pudding, and this recipe is definitely worth a repeat, I'll be making this from now on. I listened to other reviewers and cut back on the milk to 2 cups, and feel like I should have gone with the full 3 cups. The pudding was just a little thicker than it should be with the 2 cups. I don't think 3 cups of milk would cause the pudding to be runny, but I do think it would help soften the vanilla wafers up a little bit more. I also only used about 3/4 of a can of sweetened condensed milk. I didn't feel it needed the 4 bananas, I actually only ended up using 2, but I think with 3 cups of milk 3 bananas would be a good amount."
"0","5","Very awesome and so easy! I think I will make it again this weekend..."
"0","5","This was SO delicious! I thought the cream cheese might be too strong and it wasn't. It was just perfect. I also was concerned about it being too sweet, but again, it was perfect! Everyone absolutely loved it."
"0","3","This pudding was way too thick for my liking. Next time I will add less cream cheese."
"0","5","This Banana pudding is AMAZING! I have never cared much for banana pudding and made this recipe for my husband, I tasted it just to see how it was and LOVED it! So easy to make and soooooo delicious!!!"
"0","4","4-1/2 stars Warning if you live in Canada: Our measurements are NOT in ounces, so make sure you are converting the ingredients, otherwise you will have a runny pudding. My guests and I enjoyed this dessert, however, most of us found it to be too sweet. The 'Nilla' wafers had a soggy texture which some people didn't like. Other than the soggy wafers, it did taste better a full day after it was made, compared to eating it the same day (9 hours after)."
"0","5","This has to be the best banana pudding ever!"
"0","5","Yummy!!"
"0","5","I used part Vanilla pudding and part cheese cake pudding (both sugar free). I also drizzled caramel syrup on top. YUMMY!!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT!"
"0","5","This pudding is AMAZING! It's the first time I have ever made or eaten banana pudding. It was so good. My husband loved it. All he could keep saying was, 'Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm.' I'm so glad I found a new way to get rid of my ripe bananas."
"0","5","seriously so good..just make it !! easy easy easy and so good you won't put down your spoon : )"
"0","5","absolutely wonderful!!!!"
"0","5","I have made this twice, once with vanilla pudding mix and the other with banana pudding mix. Both were very good. I also crushed the vanilla wafers to help soften the crust base with the pudding mixture. Although it made a large 9x13 pan, it didn't last 24 hours in this house. Therefore, I'm off to the gym."
"0","5","We love this recipe at work. It is highly and often requested. I did make a couple of changes. I added 1/2 a box (equivalent to 5 tablespoons) of instant banana creme pudding and 1/2 a box (equivalent to 5 tablespoons) of instant vanilla pudding and more wafers. The banana creme pudding adds to the flavor. It gives it a to die for flavor."
"0","5","Thank you for this recipe!! My father in law used to make banana pudding when his children were small. My hubby had the recipe and lost it (when we moved) His father passed away before we could get it again. This came close to the taste. You made my hubby a very happy man. Thank you and God bless."
"0","5","I love this recipe. It is your basic banana pudding recipe. The cream cheese give it that creamy texture with the pudding."
"0","5","Everyone loved it! Rich and creamy. I used instant banana pudding instead of vanilla pudding, and mini Nilla wafers."
"0","5","OMG!!!!!! This was my first time making Banana Pudding. I tasted many others, homemade as well as store brought, however, hands down, this was the BEST! I had to put it in another refrigerator I have in my basement to stop myself from eating it..... Out of Sight... Out of Mind..... or so I thought! It wasn't out of my mind until it was all gone."
"0","5","My family and guests loved this banana pudding. It's super rich, but absolutely divine!"
"0","5","Made exactly as stated and my family loved it! Very rich and satisfying dessert."
"0","5","Thank you for giving this misplaced Southern girl a banana pudding recipe to call my own. I have lived out of the South too long, so I take great pride in making dishes I grew up with. I was so proud to give this to my family. They absolutely loved it! The only change I made was to add two extra bananas. Otherwise, it was perfect! Thank you so much for sharing!"
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!"
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding. My family always ask for it every holiday."
"0","5","I followed the recipe to the letter. Only added crushed vanilla wafers to the top just before serving as someone else suggested. This reminded us of cheesecake. It was fantastic. This was actually the first banana pudding I ever made, too."
"0","4","We loved this recipe. I used fat free/sugar free pudding, fat free milk and fat free condensed milk. I also used the lite cream cheese and lite whipped topping. This is a great banana pudding."
"0","5","Used Vanilla soy milk not realizing that its lack of casein proteins means that the instant pudding will not thicken. Some extra cream cheese and time in the refrigerator solved the problem. Next time I will use regular milk and a second container of whipped cream."
"0","5","'WOW' this is an excellent recipe."
"0","5","I may this for a cookout recently and everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was I did 1 3.5 oz box of vanilla pudding and 1 of chocolate pudding just because I only had one of the small ones and no big one. It turned out great though and everyone loved the chocolate twist."
"0","5","WOW! Amazing banana pudding! This is one of my favorite desserts and this was the best I've ever had! My kids and I knocked it out in a day! They are already begging for more!"
"0","4","Very good..but a little to sweet. Next time I will make a lot less since it doesn't last so long."
"0","5","everybody loves this!"
"0","5","I've made this twice in the last week! I used Lite Whip Cream, Skim Milk, Neufchatel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese, and TWO sugar free/fat free instant vanilla puddings. The first time I made it, it was a little too thick, so the second time I used 4c. milk instead of 3 and it was perfect! I do recommend using a bowl instead of 9x13 dish. It makes for a prettier presentation! Thank you for a quick and easy dessert!!!"
"0","5","Our oven's broken, so this dessert was the ideal dessert to make! Boyfriend's dad LOVED this banana pudding. Actually, everyone LOVED it. I crumbled vanilla wafers on top of the whipped cream to make it prettier, and boyfriend's dad said it tastes better with crumbled wafers (didn't know that would make a difference). Will definitely fit this into our dessert menu."
"0","5","I love it when recipes are this easy, but taste great. I also used the Pepperidge Farm Chessman instead of Nila wafers and left out the whipped topping on top. I agree that it was a bit sweet so I added fresh fruit(blueberries and strawberries) on top with a bit of chopped rosemary. Also blended 2 of the bananas into the pudding instead of slicing. Really, really good."
"0","5","This is so yummy! It actually tastes better (I think) after sitting a couple days, I even through in some mandarin oranges and that is really yummy. Thanks for posting this recipe!"
"0","4","Super good! Hubby devoured it!"
"0","5","this is the best one we've made by far! Gets rave reviews from everyone!"
"0","5","I made this Banana Pudding for all my co-workers and everyone loved it. I used Cook & Serve Vanilla Pudding, I cooked the pudding and put it in a glass bowl, then put it in the refridgerator to chill. Then I mixed the cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, a few drops of vanilla ( be cautious, this recipe is already very sweet), a little bit of regular milk, and a little bit a whipped cream, until it was well blended. After the pudding chilled I mixed the cream cheese mixture and pudding together. Then I layered my dish with Nilla Wafers, banana slices, and pudding.. repeat. It came out awesome, the next time I make this dish I will cut down to half the portion of sweetened condensed milk. Its very sweet."
"0","5","so easy & delicious!!!!"
"0","5","Great tasting and super EASY! Did make a few changes as suggested: 2 cups of milk( I used skim) I only used 6oz of lite cream cheese. I heated in microwave for a minute because forgot to leave it out for 'room temp' Added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. It was delicious! Definitely will make again!"
"0","5","I took this to my husband's work Holiday party and everyone loved it! I think the combination of the cream cheese and vanilla pudding mix made it more creamy and solid rather than runny. Definitely a keeper!"
"0","5","Followed to a tee - except used 2.5 cups of milk instead of 3 to make sure it wouldn't be runny. Add some wafers right before you eat too because the ones in the pudding get mushy, but still, everything is sooooo good and soooo easy!"
"0","5","My husband asked me to make a banana pudding for him. I have never made one nor really been a fan of banana pudding, but this recipe (AS IS) sooo good that it requires all of my mental and phisical strength not to eat it all up from him. I think i will make this one more time and reduce the SCM before I ban this pudding to holiday and group gatherings only."
"0","5","Thanks for the recipe. Very easy and simply delicious!"
"0","5","So delicious! I use half of a large box of Banana cream pudding mix and a 5oz box french vanilla pudding. Yummy stuff!"
"0","5","So good!!!!!! yummy. my husband wanted to eat it all to himself."
"0","5","AMAZING! Don't make any changes, it's perfect as it is!"
"0","5","My husband loves bananas, the rest of the family does not. I made this pudding and everyone loved it, even the non banana eaters. I have to admit, this pudding is fantastic."
"0","5","Very, very good!! I've also been trying out several banana pie recipes(the kind you make from scratch), and I think this would work VERY well for banana pie."
"0","5","made it for a dessert to bring to christmas and everyone LOVED it!!"
"0","5","Outstanding. I have never made banana pudding before, I didn't think I could make it as good as my mother-in-law. I was wrong. I think she must use just the instant pudding because this receipe blows her's out of the water. My husband is a banana pudding expert. He loved it."
"0","5","Excellent!! Made it twice already. Next time, I will use less bananas for those that don't really like them. I'm gonna make one for my daughter for her birthday."
"0","5","Best banana pudding ever!"
"0","5","Yummy...My daughter couldn't stop eating it I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk but went ahead and made it anyway and turned out good, next time I'll try with it thou."
"0","5","Very easy and the taste was to die for! However, next time I'll fold in the bananas, not beat them in. Beating the bananas in the pudding made for a baby food consistency and after a couple of days the whole mixture became oily."
"0","5","I made this with hand-whipped whipped cream and homemade vanilla wafers. It was a hit at both Christmas dinners I took it to. My mamaw even said it was the best banana pudding she'd ever had!"
"0","4","This tastes great. My pudding had lumps in it the first time....I don't think I followed the directions correctly the first time but it still tastes great!"
"0","5","My husband is from Arkansas and loves banana pudding. I thought I would try this one. He absoutley loves it and my kids devour it. I made it just as stated in the receipe. This never last in my house. I have past it on to others and they make it for their camping trips and potlucks and it is always a hit and then the receipe gets passed on again. When it is my kids birthday they always ask for banana pudding rather than a cake."
"0","5","I took this to a family pitch-in today and it was a hit!"
"0","4","Overall, everyone seemed to like it. For me, following the recipe exactly made it far too sweet. I don't know if the condensed milk is necessary for texture, but I'm going to have to try cutting down on it next time. Otherwise, it was really easy to make (my 11 yr old son made it, actually), so it's worth playing with for next time."
"0","5","This was awesome"
"0","5","Amazing Banana Cream Pie!! I always get TONS of compliments and requests for it again! I make it a little more figure friendly by using fat free cool whip and condensed milk and also sugar free pudding.. no one knows the difference!"
"0","5","My husband and son both fell in love with this!"
"0","5","OMG...this is so good. I have to add my five stars to this. I have to admit I didn't make the recipe as directed because it is too fatty. I used an 8 oz. container of fat free sour cream instead of condensed milk, neufatchel cheese substituted cream cheese, and I used skim milk. I did stick with regular Nilla cookies instead of reduced fat. The recipe is so rich anyway it doesn't taste like diet food whatsoever. Thank you so much for sharing. It's an impressive dish to bring to potlucks."
"0","5","This is amazing, a real crowd pleaser. And so easy! This is definitely going into my regular rotation for parties."
"0","5","Tastes like banana cream pie. My family loves this dessert."
"0","5","Great everybody loves it...the first time i made it the pudding wasnt as thick as i wanted it so i used a 5 oz box of vanilla pudding mix and (1)1 oz box of cheesecake pudding mix. I then let the pudding sit it in the fridge for a while before arranging the cookies and bananas. This made the pudding nice and thick without being too thick. Also im more of a cookie pudding person so i used 2 boxes of cookies instead of one. It came out great."
"0","5","Delicious and easy! I always cream my cream cheese first and it works out well."
"0","5","this was about the best I have ever had, I even make it sometimes with fat free ingredients, and its still good."
"0","5","So quick, easy, and delicious! I couldn't find 5oz packages of pudding at my grocery store, so I used one 3oz package of french vanilla and one 3oz package of banana (it was a pretty good balance, but I wouldn't recommend using all banana pudding -- it would probably taste too much of fake banana!). I used skim milk, made sure the cream cheese was fully at room temperature to make creaming easy, and wound up using ~5 bananas to make the pudding extra banana-y! I will definitely make this again!"
"0","5","A great hit for Thanksgiving!"
"0","5","The Best Banana Pudding!!!"
"0","5","My family loves this recipe. Especially the kids, and I have made it every Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past few years. One year I made it with boxed Banana pudding and no one liked it. So I went back to Vanilla Pudding and everyone was happy. So I stick to the recipe as written. No tweaking."
"0","5","I made it for a last minute event and I was surprised that everyone loved it considering the fact that I steered away from the original recipe. I didn't have sweet condensed milk on hand so I followed the recipe as is and substituted with what I did have; I used 3/4 of a can of dulce de leche. My two year old loved it even before it was ready. I don't like to experiment in my cooking/baking when it's something I'm giving someone else if I haven't previously tried it myself, but it was this or nothing. I was amazed at how delicious this was considering how easy it was to prepare. People at the party were more eagerly asking for my pudding in lieu of the birthday cake! I will definitely be making this pudding again with my 'unexpectedly unprepared' modification. My husband absolutely loved it and has already requested it for our next event. Five Stars *****!!!"
"0","5","I get requests for this all the time, and I never bring home any leftovers."
"0","5","I have made this many times and it is delicious! My only substitution is that I use banana extract instead of vanilla. Great comfort food to take to a friend in need."
"0","5","perfect!"
"0","5","Fabulous! Tasted like banana pudding is supposed to! I accidnetly bought a 1 oz box of instant vanilla pudding, and that was all that I used, and it turned out great!"
"0","5","This is the best ever!!!"
"0","5","I love this pudding. The cream cheese gives a little added richness. Everyone loves it. I make it exactly as written. A+"
"0","5","so gooooooooddd! used all light substitutes and it still tasted fantastic! even used fat free condensed milk! Def a keeper."
"0","4","Fast & Easy recipe!"
"0","5","decadent and delicious!!!!!!"
"0","5","this is so good. made as is 1 time, then kicked it up and made my own whipped cream. over the top with homemade whipped cream. cuts the sweetness a little bit but still leaves it so rich and yummy."
"0","5","yummy!!"
"0","5","This was AMAZING! I almost wanted to sneak it back in my fridge so there would be left overs. :)"
"0","3","Most of the people I served this to at a party liked it well enough, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. I am not a big Cool Whip fan and skipped the part where it is spread all over the top. If you need something fairly simple for a large group, this recipe is a winner, though. Not the most sophisticated dish, but oh well!"
"0","5","Great Banana Pudding recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as written. My husband, who is a banana pudding connoisseur, LOVED it!! Two thumbs up!!"
"0","5","This was delicious!! Everyone loved it!! I dont even really like bananas, but this was so good that i will make again."
"0","5","I love banana pudding. This one is worth the effort for sure."
"0","5","I scored some major points with this one! Thanks to Patty for making me look good. :) I have even made it without bananas for someone who doesn't like them and it was still very good just as pudding and wafers."
"0","5","This was sooooooo yummy. Thank you."
"0","4","I attempted this recipe yesterday. Went out and bought what I needed and sadly, I did not realize that I bought the cook and serve vanilla pudding. I used it anyway. And the pudding was soupy. I will try making it again at another time using the instant pudding. I would add more than 1/2 a container of the cool whip on top. But other than that, turned out okay."
"0","5","I used the recipe exactly as written. It was excellent!"
"0","5","This recipes was a HIT! My kids all stood by the casserole dish just eating it right out of the dish until it was finished. I have used other fruit with this, they loved strawberries and rasberries. I also substituted the vanilla wafers for graham craker bottom and today I'm using a shortbread cookie bottom. This recipe is always a hit and never a crumb left over."
"0","5","I thought this banana pudding was excellent! I made it for a progressive dinner where there were 6 of us and everyone loved it! I sent some home with the other couples and one of the girls emailed me to say she ate the leftovers for breakfast! I used skim milk, low fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk, and light cool whip to cut down the calories and only emptied my condensed milk about 85% of the way. I put this in a smaller yet deeper dish so that I could do two full layers of the cookies, bananas, and pudding. I also crumbled a few cookies to put on top and added some bananas right before serving. Last thing-try subbing in Pepperidge Farms Chessmen cookies instead of nilla wafers-you will not be disappointed!"
"0","5","Simply DIVINE!! I LOVED the recipe as is, but added a pack of banana pudding the second go around. Gave it a bit more flavor that my family loves! If you have a small family who only plans to eat this a day or two, halve the recipe. We still have 1/3 of the pan in the refrigerator now....3 days later."
"0","5","Definate keeper! I used low-fat condensed milk and it was plenty sweet... also did a double layer of nilla wafers and bananas.... Will make this my official 'nana pudding from now on!"
"0","4","It was good but nothing to rave about."
"0","5","Love, love, love this recipe!! I have been looking for a good banana pudding recipe for a while & this one takes the cake! To cut down on calories/sugar, I opted to use Neufchatel cheese as opposed to full fat cream cheese & I also used only 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk (really, 1/2 can is PLENTY!)."
"0","5","great light taste! takes less than 10 mins. to prepare, but make sure it is chilled for a few hours. thank you for another great recipe. my children just loved it!!"
"0","5","Better than grandma's (and that's saying a lot!). I'm not a cool whip fan, so I made me own fresh whipped cream, sweetened with a little splenda. I used a 9x13 pan, and did two cookie-banana-pudding layers. Crushed more nilla wafers over the top. The week after I made it, all I could think about was when I could make it again! Thanks for the great recipe!"
"0","5","very very good. I modified the recipe only because I was out of some of the ingredients. I used 1 small box of vanilla and 1/2 small box of banana pudding. I did not have whipped topping so I made homeade whipped cream and used that, this made it very rich. I did not sweeten the whipped cream and used 3/4 of a can of condensed milk and it came out plenty sweet. I think another layer of wafers and banana would be good next time. I also topped with real whipped cream . Really good recipe."
"0","5","This is great. I make it for parties and it goes quick. It is easy to prepare."
"0","5","I'm not a pudding person, but I totally became addicted to this recipe. I've made it a couple of times; it's pretty easy and I've had people raving over it. My husband is completely addicted. I make sure that I put a layer of Nilla wafers in between the pudding and the rest of the whipped topping and let it sit for at least a day, then they turn cake-like. So delicious!"
"0","5","I made this but used a cup of powdered sugar instead of the can of condensed milk and my family LOVES it! Bravo... =)"
"0","5","GREAT Recipe!! Super yummy and simple to make. Everyone in my family LOVED this!!! I followed the recipe just as it said and it was perfect! Just make sure that the cream cheese is at room temp."
"0","5","Made this yesterday for a family BBQ lunch and everyone really liked it. Most of the desserts I make involve chocolate, so this was a nice fresh change, especially great for summertime. Im not too keen on bananas actually, so I only used 2 large bananas and I found the amount of bananas was perfect. I also didnt use the entire can of condensed milk, maybe only about 3/4. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Thanks so much for sharing."
"0","5","This is fabulous! Family loved it!"
"0","5","Awesome banana pudding! My mom and grandmother have made the same banana pudding my entire life, but even they confessed: this is better! The only complaint: needs more bananas. I used 5, but still think it needs more. With the exception of the extra banana, I followed the recipe exactly. The cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk make the pudding rich, and really add something. Banana pudding is a southern staple and this one is a keeper."
"0","5","This recipe will make you look like a friggin superstar! The kids were sneaking downstairs at night to get some after bedtime."
"0","5","DELICIOUS! Words can not describe how much I enjoyed this banana pudding treat! This was gobbled up by my family in less than a day! We all agreed it tasted identical to the frozen banana creme pies you get at the grocer. I absolutely loved it and would certainly recommend it to anyone!"
"0","5","I needed something to give as a gift that was fast, easy, and delicious! This was it! Of course, I made doubles and kept one for the family!"
"0","5","really nice and creamy..... even though i did accidentally freeze it. (would not recommend!) still came out pretty well."
"0","5","A favorite with family and friends ~ make it less 'guilty' by using low or fat free cream cheese and whipped topping! Mmmm ~ a sure hit!"
"0","5","Excellent recipe! I've always used sugar-free/fat free jell-o pudding boxes to make banana pudding but not sure if I can get away with that since my husband loved this recipe I did modify for lower fat version and it came out perfect. I used 1 (4oz) 1/3 low fat cream cheese; 1 (4oz) fat free cream cheese; 1 reduced fat sweetened condensed milk; 1 1.5 oz sugar free/fat free instant vanilla pudding; skim milk; reduced fat cool whip and reduced fat vanilla wafers. I have to say--TASTY! Thank you!"
"0","5","AWESOME! I changed nothing and loved it."
"0","5","SUPER easy recipe! I followed the recipe to a T. I added and extra layer of Nilla wafers and bananas and topped it off with crumbled wafers! everyone at work loved!!"
"0","4","YUM, YUM, YUM-O!!!!! Made this to take to a friend's BBQ Sunday night. They all LOVED it :) My fiance didn't (but he DESPISES all fruit, esp. bananas!!!). I needed something w/ a 'soft' consistency since my friend just had his tooth extracted (he's finally upgraded to soft foods!). I must admit, I was a bit concerned at first.... After creaming my 'room temp.' cream cheese (I soaked my entire foil-wrapped pkg. in hot tap H2O for 10 min.) & then adding the other ingredients, I found my pudding mix. to be VERY soupy (and my cream cheese did not blend in well either...). After whipping everyting on high speed for ~ 5 min w/ my whisk attachment (I used my KitchenAid for this), all was fine (whew!). When I added the Cool-whip, my pudding was very pale (almost white), so I added a few drops of yellow food coloring, being careful to blend really well, & viola - I had a perfect pale yellow 'banana' pudding! For a fancy presentation, I made 2 layers in my Pampred Chef trifle bowl, topped w/ the rest of my Cool-whip (I purchased a 12 oz. container) & sprinkled w/ a few crushed Nilla wafers. I hope tomorrow's leftovers are just as good as the REAL thing (I tossed my bananas w/ lemon juice - I'll have to see if this slows the browning process over time or if I need to invest in some Fruit Fresh for this purpose)! Thx. for sharing your recipe Patty :)"
"0","5","Oh my goodness....best banana pudding I've ever had!!! This was a huge hit at our 4th of July BBQ. LOVE IT! The whipped topping makes the dish!"
"0","5","i made this exactly as stated and it was absolutely awesome! i am soooo glad i didnt change it according to all the other reviewers who said to use vanilla and banana pudding. it was wonderful exactly as written. i guess that's why you should always try it first as written. i used lowfat condensed milk, lite coolwhip, 1/3 fat cream cheese. for the milk i cant remember for sure, but i am betting i used skim milk. will make this alot from now on!! thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This is the best Banana Pudding I have ever ate. I made this for Father's Day and everyone wanted the recipe. Make sure to sprinkle crush vanilla waffers on top like in the picture makes it very pretty!!! This recipe deserves a 10+ rating. I never leave reviews but this deserves one."
"0","5","Made this for Father's Day. Was gone in a flash. All the review comments were very helpful. I used 5 sliced bananas. Dipping the banana slices in fresh lemon juice not only preserves the bananas nicely but also give this recipe a little zing. Loved it. Will make this again!"
"0","1","The pudding mixture was so thick I could barely scrape it out of the bowl to throw it out. I think 5oz. of instant pudding mix to 3 cups of milk is a little off."
"0","5","Out of many years of making different recipes this one is the best. Everyone loved it!"
"0","5","Phenominal recipe! Have made this recipe a few times now. Completely gone everytime. Had one of the girls at work tell me it reminded her of her mom's recipe. The only thing I changed was the cool whip added a little more on top and sprinkled crushed nilla cookies. Soo Yummy! Thanks a bunch!"
"0","5","I'm not a big fan of banana pudding, but I have to say that this is a great recipe. My husband loves it and in the 13 years we've been together, I've never made it for him. I decided to do it for Father's Day, hoping I didn't mess up a recipe I've never made. Turned out to be VERY easy and he thought it was great! It set up very nicely making a very pretty dessert. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","This was one of the first recipes that I followed completely and the results were awesome. I made this for a dinner party with another family and the kids completely devoured the dessert, leaving only a taste for us parents. That's the mark of a successful dessert. Six out six children rated this pudding 5 stars!!!"
"0","3","Well it turned out well, I guess I just wasn't a fan of all the whipped topping. While I was making it (and taste testing it ;)) I thought it was soooo good BEFORE I added the whipped topping. Then, I felt like I ruined it. I will make it again, just minus the whipped topping."
"0","5","This is by far my family's favorite banana pudding ever. I am making it again today for an early Father's Day dinner. I would not change a thing about this recipe it is amazing! Enjoy!"
"0","5","This is awesome! I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat nilla wafers, fat free whipped topping, and fat free sugar free pudding mix and it tasted so creamy! No one would have ever guessed."
"0","5","Great! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I did like the photo shows.... Lining the vanilla cookies around the edges and adding some crushed on top for a pretty presentation!"
"0","4","Be sure to blend the cream cheese with the sweetened condensed milk BEFORE adding the rest of the ingredients. Mine turned out lumpy, but still tastes really, really good."
"0","5","This is SO easy and SO good- everyone always loves it!"
"0","5","MMM! So rich and delicious! This does make a LOT, so either cut the recipe in half or make it for a crowd. I made it with Neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat than cream cheese) and it turned out great."
"0","5","This was a terrific banana pudding. It was made according to the recipe. One of my daughters thought it was a little too sweet, though, so I may cut down on the condensed milk a little next time and use fat free cream cheese."
"0","5","yummmmmmy. This was so easy and tasty. Thank you!"
"0","5","perfect recipe"
"0","4","I really liked this recipe. I made some changes, but it still went into the permanent cookbook. I used one pureed banana and beat it into the cream cheese. I also doubled the vanilla, and read the reviews and followed what others said with the pudding; I used 2/3 of a small packet of banana cream pudding and 2/3 of a packet of vanilla pudding. I also used real cream instead of milk (and added just a bit more to compensate for the thickness). I put this into a trifle dish and layered it with the vanilla wafers. It turned out really good. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top for visual decor. I skipped the sliced bananas and whipped topping on the top, just so it would be easier to store."
"0","5","This is the first and only time I've written a review. I usually don't feel the recipes deserve the 'hipe', however this one DOES! It is so creamy and delicious."
"0","5","soooo delicious. My whole family loved it."
"0","5","This was very Delicious!! Very easy to make. My family & friends loved it. This recipe will be added to the family favorites. Thank you for sharing :)"
"0","5","Fabulous! I made this for my son's birthday and everyone loved it. My husband ate half the pan."
"0","5","Fantastic. I was skeptical about using the condensed milk and the cream cheese, but did it anyway. I omitted the whipped cream, used 2 cups 2% milk and one cup of condensed milk, added all that plus the banana cream pudding mix and cream cheese in a blender and blended. I also sprinkled lemon juice over my cut bananas so they won't brown. This is better than my mama's. I made it last night and already have had 4 bowls of it. Can't wait to make for others...."
"0","5","Now that's what I'm talkin' about!!! This recipe is so easy to make and tastes awesome. Made as written, delish..."
"0","4","Delicious but a little too sweet for my taste! I uesd nonfat milk to lighten it up a bit. To serve I layered the pudding, then banana slices then another layer of pudding. I topped with whipped cream and slivered almonds. I think it would go best following a lighter, rather than heavy, meal. Guests loved it!"
"0","5","I made this for a work function and got so many compliments. It was fairly easy to make and super yummy. Can't wait to find another reason to make it!"
"0","5","Out of this world!! I took this to a party and it was gone in 20 minutes. Thanks for making me look like a hero!! Fantastic recipe!!!"
"0","5","A friend had me try banana pudding a while back so I decided to make some on my own. I came home and looked up this recipe and made it. It is AWESOME (far better than my friends!). I literally could sit and eat the entire batch by myself (however, not advisable!). So yummy!"
"0","5","Yum-make it in a trifle dish with the cookies layered on the outside and it will look as good as it tastes!"
"0","4","delicious and easy to make!"
"0","5","this is amazing. I love banana pudding an thought that my recipe waws the best but this one really takes the cake!"
"0","5","This is AWESOME! I usually make the baked banana pudding but I was running behind and made this one instead. I made 2 batches and can't wait to get home to finish off!"
"0","5","This stuff it the BEST!!! Banana Pudding that is easy to make and has a taste thats 'Outta This World'... What else could you ask for??? The whole family loves it. It seems that I get asked every other week to make it!! It's a keeper!!"
"0","5","This was delicious. I hope everyone knows to thoroughly soften the cream cheese before proceeding. I used the entire box of vanilla wafers like other reviewers suggested. The layers were: 1/2 box wafers, bananas, 1/2 the pudding, remaining wafers, remaining pudding, reserved Cool Whip. I also used my mini chopper to chop/grind 6-8 vanilla wafers and sprinkled them on top of the Cool Whip. It looked so pretty!"
"0","5","We served this to over 120 guests at our church's ladies tea and got rave reviews with plenty of recipe requests. The only alteration we made was to use small cups for individual size servings. This is a definite keeper!!!"
"0","5","Just love it. This is definitely a keeper and one I will be making often."
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!!! I halved the recipe for 5 of us and it was plenty, with 3 small servings remaining. Used yellow spotted bananas for the best flavor and followed the directions exactly. I thought about using half vanilla and half banana pudding, but ended up just using vanilla and we all thought it had a great banana flavor, especially the next day. Next time I will try to make it the day before serving. I also made it in a medium sized casserole dish and layered everything twice, which was perfect! Definitely my new banana pudding recipe!!"
"0","4","I'm glad I read the reviews first about only using a half can of sweetened condesnsed milk. I used one 3.4oz of vanilla instant pudding, and 1 3.4oz package of banana cream pudding. I did use all 3 cups of milk, after putting in the first 2 cups and letting it thicken, it was a little too thick. Everything else I followed straight from the recipe!! Will be making this over and over again!"
"0","5","Wow! Amazing! I love the flavor of bananas, but not the texture, so I blended five bananas and added them in layers. I also added cinnamon and used biscoff cookies instead of wafers."
"0","5","MY 10 YR OLD NIECE AND HER 10 YR OLD FRIEND MADE THIS FOR OUR WEEKLY COOKING CLASS....IT WAS A BIG HIT..."
"0","5","I have made this several times. If I'm not making it for a lot of people I make the pudding in the 1st step and save halve of it until later. You can also make the pudding itself Then fix up dessert dishes with a layer of wafers and bananas put the pudding mixture in and then just add whip topping to the top. I do not ever use banana pudding with this."
"0","5","My family LOVED this! Followed other reviewers advice and used one small box banana cream pudding mix and one small french vanilla pudding mix. Used all the condensed milk and everything else and it was PERFECT!!"
"0","4","This was delicious! I made it as a dessert to compliment my Easter feast. Let me tell ya, I just had ANOTHER bowl of it, and its just spectacular the longer it sits in the fridge! I did however make a few changes as requested in the other reviews. I used 1- 3 oz box of french vanilla jell-o & 1/2 box banana cream jell-o, 1/2 the can of sweet milk, 2 cups of milk and other than that I followed the recipe. I made a huge bowl full of this creamy, sweet goodness and I will definitely make it again in the future! YUM-O-RIOUS!!"
"0","5","My husband and I loved it!! The only bad thing was we didnt eat it fast enough so half of it was wasted."
"0","5","Made this last weekend and it was very yummy! Took the advice of using half a can of condensed milk instead of the whole can, and I also used the cook and serve pudding instead of instant; better than with instant in my opinion. I omitted the cream cheese just b/c I wasn't too sure about it in banana pudding but I will try it next time since the reviews are so great. Served the pudding in a round serving bowl and chilled it for about 12 hours... it was excellent!"
"0","5","This was an excellent recipe. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I made it in a trifle dish, and it was very pretty. My husband loved it, and we will definitely make this one again. I wouldn't change a thing! I was afraid it might taste artificial because of the instant pudding and Cool Whip, but it's great and so easy. Thank you for this recipe!"
"0","4","Very good,and sweet!"
"0","5","Basic, light & yummy! Will definitely make again..thank you!"
"0","5","Loved it. I used French Vanilla pudding and French Vanilla Cool Whip and it was out of control tasty. I have to do this one again, soon! My friends flipped on how good it was!"
"0","5","WOW! Didn't think I would be to crazy about this recipe but it was awesome! 9x13 inch tray gone in two days! You gotta try it! Fantastic!"
"0","5","This is so YUMMY!!! Everyone loved it. I kept it exactly how it says to make it. Everyone loved it! No leftovers!!"
"0","5","I used all fat-free or sugar free products to make this and it was amazing. I only used 3/4 of the can of sweetened condensed milk. This is definitely a keeper, I can only imagine that the full fat/sugar version is spectacular!"
"0","5","Loved it! Would recommend using room-temperature cream cheese, as it was hard to remove all the little white specks from the pudding. Yum, yum, yum."
"0","5","I loved it and so did everyone at work! I changed the recipe by accident but it turned out better. I put 2 3.5oz boxes of instant vanilla pudding instead of 1 5oz. But it made the pudding thicker and richer! ummmm!ummm! good!"
"0","4","THIS IS SO CLOSE TO PAULA DEAN'S 'NOT YO MOMMAS BANAN PUDDIN', JUST NOT CLOSE ENOUGH. THE USE OF FRENCH VANILLA PUDDING AND CHESSMEN COOKIES, MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. STILL A VERY GOOD PUDDING, JUST NO M FAVORITE!"
"0","4","Tasted great, but I wish the puddling would have firmed up more."
"0","4","My husband enjoyed this but I had a tough time getting the consisency right, I don't know it just wasn't my thing."
"0","5","My son and husband really loved this recipe and they are picky when it comes to banana pudding. I will definitely make this again."
"0","5","This is really good. I used fat free milks and reduced fat cream cheese."
"0","5","Everyone loved it. I have made a different variation of banana pudding every year (for 5 or more years) and this is the first time ppl said they liked this recipe better than our childhood recipe (which consisted of 3 ingredients). Thanks!"
"0","5","This is such an amazing recipe! I make it exactly as the recipe states with the exception of adding a half a teaspoon of almond extract (YUM!) and I make sure it sits overnight in the fridge so the cookies get nice and soft. Very easy to double so that you can make an extra batch for neighbors or work. Enjoy!"
"0","4","This was a nice change for a sweet treat. My husband loves Banana's so I made this for him. Next time I would use more cookies in the bottom and maybe crush some and sprinkle on top."
"0","5","great recipe. tastes traditional. i used homemade whipped cream, and didn't put it on top. i used extra cookies, but next time i won't. i like that i don't have to cook it, but it tastes like i did. definitely add the bananas when making because they give it the flavor. they turn, but that's the way its traditionally made, and tastes wonderful. using banana flavored pudding and adding the bananas when serving ruins the recipe if you want a homemade pudding. if you don't... why not just make instant banana pudding, and serve it with sliced banana and cool whip on top. that would be much faster and easier. personally if i going to go through the trouble of making something, i want it to taste homemade, even if i take a few small shortcuts like recipe does."
"0","5","Great banana pudding, maybe use a little extra milk because it gets pretty thick but other than that it is really good! Thanks."
"0","4","This was good for a fast recipe. It was gone in 10 minutes. Its not as good as the longer cooked version but wonderful for a fast dessert."
"0","5","You have to try this recipe!!! I made the dish because my son loves banana pudding...now I do to (and so does everyone else in my house, my parents house, my job and my best friends house). One thing...it is VERY rich but it is DELICIOSIOUS!!!"
"0","5","Absolutely yummy! I thought this was different due to the whipped topping folded into the pudding. It gave the pudding a light, fluffy taste I don't think I've ever tasted in banana pudding. At first, I was very worried it would turn out poorly. I neglected to read a popular review that urged ROOM TEMPERATURE CREAM CHEESE. It really is a must; my pudding had so many lumps even after I mixed it about 10 minutes longer on high! The chilling process seemed to help because there was not one lump in the final product. I think the only other change I will make is using half a can of sweetened condensed milk, as several other reviewers suggested. Me and my family love sweets but I was the only one that thought this was a tad too sweet! (Everyone else loved it!) I also crumbled extra cookies on top of the pudding before allowing it to chill in the refrigerator. This made for a nice (and easy) presentation."
"0","5","This is wonderful! I want to make it again and again! My husband does not like bananas in his pudding - so the is now called my bananaless pudding. I did not use the entire can of sweet con. milk and ran a bit low on the cool whip. This is yummy, yummy, yummy, will make again and again!!"
"0","5","Wow! Great, and I'm not usually a huge fan of banana pudding. The cream cheese made it really nice and custard-y. I used half of the condensed milk (and don't make the mistake of using evaporated milk), and it was great! In a 9x13 pan, the second half of the cool whip barely covered it, so if you like that stuff you might use the 12-oz tub."
"0","5","Made this exactly as written and it was perfect. Got many compliments at the carry-in dinner and the dish was nearly empty when time to go home. Very rich without being over-the-top sweet. Perfect in every way!"
"0","4","Wonderful! Extremely easy! I used the two smaller boxes of both sugar free vanilla and banana cream instant pudding mix, a whole can of condensed milk (lower fat version), fat free cool whip, skim milk and fat free cream cheese. I was concerned that by cutting calories it would cut flavor as well but it was still delicious and I was able to enjoy it even more knowing that I saved so many calories. The only reason I would not rate this as the 'best' is because the instant banana pudding taste kind of overwhelms the taste. I think next time I would use two boxes of french vanilla instead."
"0","5","The best banana pudding I have ever had!!"
"0","5","This is delicious just the way it is!!!"
"0","5","This is always a hit in my house. Try it...you will be hooked too. I also used the instant pudding and it worked just fine."
"0","4","iused the one box of vanilla, next time i will use 1 small bananna and one small vanilla."
"0","5","This is very good. It's so rich and creamy you'll want to serve small portions. This is the only banana pudding I will make from now on."
"0","5","I loved it! I also used half of the amount of condensed milk and it turned out great."
"0","4","this recipe is very good- but I had trouble getting the cream cheese to not be lunpy- but good flavor and very easy!"
"0","5","This is a wonderful recipe. Everyone wants this recipe everytime I take it to a party. Only thing I might do different is add a little more whipped topping on the top. But otherwise it is perfect! Never any leftovers!!!"
"0","5","This is so good!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!!"
"0","4","I would be honest in saying I prefer a cooking banana pudding more than this but for being so simple you can't pass this up! I did it in layers but I would recommend upping the cool whip to 12 oz but still using only 4 ounces in the mix. The 8 oz just didn't leave enough for a decent coating on the top."
"0","4","Very good!"
"0","5","My family loves this recipe. I have made it for many potlucks and family dinners with great success. I put it in a trifle dish for a dramatic presentation. It is very sweet, but since it's a dessert, it's expected."
"0","5","I made this last night - our guests didn't stop talking about it the entire time they were here!!! I used 1 small package of vanilla pudding and 1 small package of banana pudding - I used 1.5 cups of cold whole and 1.5 cups of cold heavy cream - I didn't use the whole can of condensed milk - and I used the extra creamy cool-whip. I used my stand mixer and beat this on high so it whipped up the heavy cream and made for a really yummy whipped, creamy texture! I used my trifle dish which resulted in 2 layers of vanilla wafers, bananas, and pudding. I've uploaded a picture - it was beautiful! THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!"
"0","5","THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BANANA PUDDING IN THE WORLD. I made it a few times over the holidays and guests rave. It is so easy. I use sugar free pudding- one small box of banana cream flavor and one box of vanilla. My friend says its better than the Paula Deen banana pudding she has made."
"0","5","Just awesome. I LOVE how rich this is. I think this has to be my favorite recipe I have made from this website so far!"
"0","5","I doubled the recipe for an office birthday party - and it turned out GREAT! The best, thickest, yummiest banana pudding EVER!!!!!!!!! I was a little worried about the cream cheese flavor, but I shouldn't have. I even made it two days in advance (made and then b-day girl was out so it sat an extra day) and it was still PERFECT! Dip your banana slices in lemon juice to keep them from turning though. I also did several layers in a pretty glass bowl. YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","good for dessert  awesome to eat while watching a movie on the couch"
"0","5","AMAZING! BEST BANANA PUDDING IVE EVER HAD!! :) WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING ABOUT IT!!"
"0","5","I made this for the first time Thanksgiving 2008 for my husband's family (professional cooks and critics!). I was very nervous to present but they LOVED it!!!! In fact, I am the designated banana pudding maker for the family!!!! I did modify the recipe: I used 2 cups of whole milk, 3.5oz of banana flavored pudding and 1/2 can of condensed milk. I am making this for New Years dinner and I am going to use a suggestion of crushed wafers and butter to make a 'crust'. AWESOME!!!!!!!!"
"0","5","This is an excellent recipe! My husband fixed this for Christmas and everyone loved it including my dad who is very hard to please. We will definately be keeping this one!"
"0","5","This recipe worked out wonderfully...I've already made it twice this holiday season and got the praises of my family's veteran cook great grandmom. The only thing I changed was using mini vanilla wafers and actually mixed some in with the pudding to give it a little extra somethin'... can't wait to make it again"
"0","5","My family loved this dish! I actually used the ready made the Philly read made cheesecake filling because it was all I had. AND IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL! It turned out creamier and more like a dessert!"
"0","5","I just had to let everyone know that this was my first time making a special dessert for Christmas and EVERYONE LOVED IT! I also took ppl's advice and did half french vanilla and half banana cream pudding. Put a little lemon on the chopped banana's and Voila! a beautiful and delicious dessert!"
"0","5","I too used 3.5oz vanilla pudding & the 3.5oz banana cream pudding along w/ 2 1/2 cups milk.I made it today for christmas & everyone loved it,this is the best banana pudding.This will be made for many years to come."
"0","4","I will up the cookies next time and add only three bananas."
"0","5","YUM! It was very good and incredibly easy to make!"
"0","5","Totally awesome"
"0","5","This was so good, my boyfriend almost ate the whole thing by himself because he said it was the best he ever had."
"0","5","This recipe turned out AWESOME! I followed it exactly with the only exception being an extra layer of cookies and bananas in the middle. I was concerned when the cream cheese didn't blend well and left tiny lumps throughout the pudding mixture, but once it was all put together, you couldn't tell a bit and the taste totally made up for it! My bunco group LOVED it and I've already sent out the link to the recipe! UPDATE: I made this a second time and mixed the sweetened condensed milk with the cream cheese, then added the pudding and vanilla, following up with the milk a little at a time. This helped the consistency tremendously! Very smooth, no lumps! Another hit :)"
"0","4","leave bananas out to serving"
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding recipe & very easy to make."
"0","5","Made as written, this pudding was awesome!!! Thanks for a GREAT recipe"
"0","5","Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!!!!!! My husband and my son LOVED this recipe, and I plan to make it again...and at social gatherings!! Thanks!"
"0","5","This banana pudding was awesome! The only changes I made was I used 2 3.4oz boxes of instant vanilla pudding and I used the whole box of cookies. I used whole milk (bc that was all I had) and the whole can of condensed milk. I received so many rave reviews about it! Thanks for sharing this recipe."
"0","5","sooooooooooooooo good!!! My families favorite!!!"
"0","5","Just like grandma used to make DEEEElicious!"
"0","5","I have made this several times, and get rave reviews every time, everyone loves it, even a picky teenage boy."
"0","5","This was really good and very easy to make."
"0","5","My family loved this recipe and so did I. My mother is already asking me to make another batch! She also said that I had my father beat with making Banana Pudding, thanks to this recipe!!"
"0","5","yummy! Followed it to a T. So so good:)"
"0","5","This recipe was so delicious and a perfect consistancy. I did do a few changes: cream cheese at room temp., home made whipped cream, and half a can of sweetened condensed milk. I made the home made whip cream because i like it way better then cool whip and it only takes a few minutes to whip up. And as for the condensed milk, i had made another recipe before this one that called for half, so i only reserved half for this. I dont know if it would be too sweet with the entire can in, but i know it was great with half."
"0","3","It was good but we could only eat a little at a time because it was too sweet."
"0","3","Although I thought this was good, it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I would only use half of the sweetened condensed milk and I would add more bananas and more wafers. I think with those changes it would be much better."
"0","5","Awesome recipe! Make sure to whip/cream the cream cheese very well before adding all the other ingredients. I forgot and had little lumps in the pudding, but the taste made up for it. My 4 year old loved helping me layer the cookies and bananas. Next time I will put this in a taller dish and layer the cookies and bananas. I may add a little marshmallow cream to the whip cream on top :) This is going to stay in the recipe box forever!"
"0","5","My husband and I loved this pudding very much. I was a bit surprised because I've never made it this way before. It took us a week to finish it off, but we looked forward to it every evening!"
"0","4","My family loves this! To me, it is good, but not the ultimate banana pudding recipe I'm still looking for. However, given it's ease and how much everyone raves, it is a wonderful recipe and will be made again and again in my house."
"0","5","My Husband and Step-daughter loved this Banana Pudding. They were skeptical with me making it. I've never made Banana Pudding. And I'm not a fan of it. I made it for my Step-daughter's 12th Birthday! She was beyond blown away! I followed the suggestions of a reviewer. The only thing I changed was that I put it in a crystal bowl instead of a baking dish."
"0","5","This is a very tasty recipe. I actually came up with one very close to this by accident one day. It is very rich for me so I can only eat a little at a time, but it is very good."
"0","4","I thought it was good, but a little too much on the sweet side."
"0","4","I made this recipe almost as is--only used 2.5 cups of milk. It is very good, but very sweet. When I make it again I will try 1/2 to 3/4 of the can of sweetened condensed milk.  Will definitely make again when I am craving 'nana pudding. The cream cheese makes it so smooth and gives it a hint of tang."
"0","5","I thought this was the easiest and I like some substituted the vanilla pudding with 1/2 banana pudding and 1/2 french vanilla. I say keep the higher fat cream cheese as oppose to low fat, it gives it a more sweet and creamy mix."
"0","5","Excellent. Very creamy. I used light cool whip topping instead of regular and skim milk to cut some of the calories."
"0","5","Came out perfect. VERY VERY rich!!"
"0","5","WOW!!!!! That is an amazing recipe! I felt like I was eating my Grandmother's banana pudding! This will be my recipe from here on out! Thank you for another great recipe!"
"0","5","This recipe has my three favorite qualities to it. It was delicious. It was easy. And it was quick. Two thumbs up. It will be made many times again in our household."
"0","5","This stuff should be illegal! It was a hit. I am not a huge dessert person, but I loved loved loved this recipe. It reminds me of the one my grandma used to make. To make it a little lighter I used Neufatchel cheese instead of cream cheese, sugar free pudding mix, fat free cool whip and 3 cups nonfat milk. It was still super rich even with those modifications. I thought it was fabulous."
"0","5","just going to add to the popular opinion that this pudding is spectacular!!!"
"0","4","I followed the directions exactly... I love banana pudding and eat it every chance i get. This was a good one and i love cream cheese in anything so i thought it was going ot be out of this world but, it was just waaaaaay too sweet for me!! But the texture was outstanding! i don't think i would make this recipe again..."
"0","5","This is, hands down the best banana pudding recipes. The only thing I would change is the cookie...I know...how can you change the Nilla Wafer. It's so traditional. But let me tell you if you use the chessmen cookie by pepridge farms you won't be disappointed. Everyone loves this when I make it. I even have a friend that tells everyone that I make the best banana pudding ever. Ha ha ha. Also, a cook's tip: If you quickly dip your bananas in fresh lemon juice or lemon-lime soda it will keep the bananas from turning brown"
"0","5","I love banana pudding and this is the best I have ever tried. So yummy!"
"0","5","This recipe has a very good flavor. I think next time I will use only 2 cups of Milk for a thicker consistancy. Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","THIS IS REALLY GOOD!! I LIKE TO MAKE MY OWN WHIPPED CREAM."
"0","5","I followed this recipe to the tee and it was awesome. Don't let all the other reviews on here persuade you to change the recipe, it needs no changes of any kind. I would highly suggest making this the night before you are going to consume it as the banana flavor infuses the pudding mixture and the pudding mixture turns to somewhat of a cheesecake! Oh, I served this at my hubby's birthday...I used the mini vanilla wafers and decorated the top of the dish to spell out 34 and then put candles all over it. Fun!"
"0","4","The pudding was a little firm. I would use a little more milk next time. I made it in individual glass dishes so that it would be easy to pick up as a snack out of the fridge. Make sure it sits for a few hours or overnight before serving or the cookies will be too hard."
"0","5","This recipe has been in my family forever! It tastes exactly like I remember as a child. It can't get better than this."
"0","5","I would give this 10 stars if I could - simply AMAZING!!! I made this for my boyfriend and he went nuts over it - finished the whole pan in like 2 days! I even loved it and I am not a big banana person. Great and easy recipe!"
"0","5","Very easy and good. I would add more banana's and even mix them in the pudding. But will make again."
"0","5","This is wonderful! Everyone raved about it. I changed two things. I only used 2/3 of a can of the condensed milk, and I also used a box each of french vanilla pudding and banana creme pudding. Turned out fabulous."
"0","5","So good! My husband always asks me to make this dessert for him! I do make a couple of changes. I crush the vanilla wafers with a rolling pin. Also, I use 2 small pkgs of pudding and I always end up using more bananas and whipped cream than stated in the recipe. One of our favorite desserts!"
"0","5","This is awesome. I made it the day before a party, so the banana flavor had time to permeate the whole dish. EVERYONE asked for the recipe at our dinner party."
"0","5","This is so yummy. I've only made it once but it was awesome. I will be making it again. I did use french vanilla pudding, but other than that followed the directions."
"0","5","Love it. It was easy and delish!"
"0","5","Awesome recipe, thanks!"
"0","5","this is the most wonderful banana pudding i've ever had. my family and everyone who has tried it loves it. i give it 5 stars. it's awesome."
"0","5","This is delicious! My husband loved it! Thanks! I didn't change anything to the recipe, it was great just as it was!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe, but skipped the sweetened milk; I used 5 or 6 bananas and tossed them in lemon juice prior to assembly. I also used the entire tub of cool whip w/the pudding and omitted it from the top. I crushed the remaining nilla wafers and sprinkled on top prior to refrigeration. It was GREAT!!"
"0","5","This recipe has been in my family for years. My father-in-law tells me not to bother showing for family functions unless I bring the banana pudding! It's very rich, you can't eat alot in one sitting but you always come back for more later!"
"0","5","Best banana pudding EVER!! I get asked to bring this every time there is a dessert to be made!"
"0","5","I follow this recipe to the T and it turns out great every time. It's a big hit with our family and friends and were asked to make it a lot at our get togethers.  Thanks for this delicious recipe."
"0","5","OK, Let’s see.. THE BEST pudding I ever had! I have to laugh when I read other people’s reviews to complain about the banana turns brown. What? Who cares? This pudding is soooo great it would NEVER stay in the fridge for a couple of days! I made it for July 4th, people loved it, I only had a very small left over for the next morning and it was AMAZING! DO PREPARE IT A DAY BEFORE! IT’S WORTH IT! SOOO MUCH BETTER! One thing I didn’t get: Pudding comes in small package and the bigger one is 3.5 oz. I thought I didn’t copy the recipe right so I just put the big one in it but as I double-checked it I see the recipe does ask for 5 oz.  I don’t think it needs that much because my pudding tasted delicious as it was but I might try it with the 5 oz. next time.. which I can’t wait for!!! Yummmm"
"0","5","Outstanding flavor and so simple to make. A great potluck dish."
"0","5","Easy, delicious recipe. I did use two 3.4 oz instant banana pudding instead of vanilla. The pudding was simple wonderful. Family and friends loved it!"
"0","5","INSANELY tasty!!!!! I used one box of regular Jello brand vanilla pudding plus 1/2 box of Jello French vanilla, stacked it all up in my trifle bowl, covered and let it chill overnight. Very easy to make. I have never made banana pudding before, but I will definitely be making this again, if only for myself!"
"0","5","This was a pretty easy recipe. I misplaced my Layered Banana Pudding recipe and this one came close. I misread the recipe and purchased 2 one oz packages of pudding. I just reduced the milk accordingly. I mixed it until it was somewhat fluffy. (I'm not sure that there is a 5 oz package of pudding.) Anyway it was pretty good. My husband loved it. My brother and nephew had some thought it needed more cookies and so did I. I'll put cookies in the middle of the pudding mixture next time. Otherwise it was really righ and yummy!  I'm making it again this weekend with the proper amount of pudding and I'll add more cookies. Will report with update later."
"0","5","This recipe is SOOOO yummy! I have had several requests to make this pudding. It's easy to make and quite rich. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","TRUELY the best and easiest banana pudding EVER! I read reviews and went on and used 1/2 banana & 1/2 vanilla pudding and it was amazing, taste even better the next day!...store was out of vanilla wafers so I used shortbread cookies...just HEAVENLY delicious!"
"0","5","This is an easy to follow recipe that is delicious."
"0","5","One day and it was gone!!! delicious. My husband has wanted me to make this for a long time, I finally found a recipe on this site and tried it for the 4th of July cookout. So yummy and creamy, I used 4 bananas, I did toss my sliced bananas in lemon juice to keep them from browning but it was gone so fast I wouldnt have needed too. THANKS"
"0","4","This recipe is good. The only things I changed was the sweetness. I didn't add the sweetened condensed milk because I thought the pudding was sweet enough just adding in the instant pudding mix itself."
"0","5","kids esp like it"
"0","5","Great banana pudding.My whole family enjoyed but I used a small thing of whipping cream and only used 2 1/2 cups milk. My fiance loved it !!"
"0","5","This banana pudding gets RAVE reviews every time I make it. Quick, easy, and fabulous."
"0","3","This recipe was pretty good, but nothing to write home about in my opinion. I much prefer a recipe I have used for a baked banana pudding; it's called 'Maya Angelou's Highly Superior Banana Sweet.' You can find it if you do a Google search."
"0","5","absolutely the best banana pudding i have ever eaten!"
"0","5","Y-U-M! Followed recipe exactly - pudding is rich, creamy and cool."
"0","5","So simple and quick. It makes for the perfect family recipe! I didn't layer it all pretty because dinner finished a little faster than I had planned and by the time it was time to eat the pudding, we couldn't move. Lazily, my husband and I just dipped the wafers into the mix which I think we would like better anyway. Kids would probably too. Just a fun alternative to eating it. GREAT recipe!"
"0","5","Perfect recipe! Not too sweet like other recipes."
"0","5","This was great! I made this for about 10 people and EVERY SINGLE PERSON was amazed. I have been looking at allrecipes.com for about 5 years, and this is my first review. I had to finally bite the bullet! Thank you!"
"0","5","I pretty much followed as directed except for a few modifications. I used a small box of vanilla pudding mix instead of the larger box (it's what I had on hand). I folded in 1/2 mashed banana with pudding mixture to give it more of a banana taste. And instead of placing more whipped topping on top, I topped with crushed vanilla wafers. I also brought the cream cheese to room temperature, which is very important for creating a smooth texture. I brought this to my in-laws Father's Day gathering and my husband's entire family loved it. It makes for a great potluck dessert too. I will definately make it again."
"0","5","This is too good for words. My father-in-law raved after every bite! I portioned into individual serving ramekins; sprinkled with crumbled vanilla wafers just before serving. Beautiful and delicious! Thanks for sharing this gem!"
"0","5","I just fixed this and it was great. This was the first time I have ever tried to fix banana pudding and I am glad I fixed this one. My daughter is a very picky eater and she loved it. I will be repeating this for years to come. Thanks so much for sharing."
"0","5","This is wonderful banana pudding! I thought the one I made was really good, but this one is even better. I didn't change a thing. I did have to make a double batch, because one batch was for a family reunion, and my husband wanted to make sure we had some at home!! He loves it!"
"0","5","This recipe has become my bread and butter for family functions and church events. People actually get mad when I don't do it for our bakesales. It's helping me make my first missions trip to Haiti so thanks on so many levels."
"0","4","it was good but nothing super unique or super special"
"0","4","Very easy to make, good size for a family get-together. Tastes really good too."
"0","4","Quite tasty and very simple to make. Not quite like mama used to make it but it will do."
"0","5","Perfect!!"
"0","5","Great recipe. My husband loves banana pudding and I decided to try this recipe and it was FANTASTIC. Our kids loved it just as much as he did. Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing. I'll be making it again soon."
"0","5","This was excellent, can't wait to make it again. Funny story... I accidently put in balsamic vinegar in stead of the vanilla... didn't realize it until AFTER we ate it, and it was still good (but I wouldn't recommend!)"
"0","5","My family loves this recipe...its, very easy to make.......i have taken this to parties and everyone request that i bring this everytime.......LOVE IT"
"0","5","My favorite banana pudding recipe, however, instead of using the vanilla wafers, my family likes Ginger Snaps..Delish!!"
"0","5","I love this recipe. It's always a hit and get requested to make this recipe rather if it's family get togethers, parties or even work. Always in demand. Been making for years."
"0","5","The best banana pudding i've ever had. Fan favorite at potlucks and family gatherings !!!"
"0","5","I didn't know puddign could be so good! I didn't use bananas because I don't care for them, but I did use strawberries...could be used for a cheesecake filling!!!"
"0","5","This was the best Banana Pudding! I'm making it again this weekend for company coming into town- that way I won't feel compelled to polish it off all by myself like last time!"
"0","5","Wonderful! Very easy recipe to follow. I made this for my banana lovin' husband and he thought it was the bomb!"
"0","5","Awesome!! And so easy to make! Made it for a family bbq and everyone raved about it."
"0","5","Oh my goodness, this recipe is so YUMMY! I got nothing but compliments and requests for the recipe when I made it for my family's recent gathering. I made it just the way the recipe says."
"0","5","Fantastic Recipe for banana pudding! I'd tasted it before but never had the recipe. This pudding was a hit with family and co-workers! Thanks for sharing. Note: I omitted the extra whipped topping and finished with a few vanilla wafers."
"0","1","I've never made this before. I tried to do it following the instructions, but got confused with the Vanilla pudding mix. IS THE PUDDING supposed to be made BEFORE I add it to the cream cheese? I just dumped in the powder...after 3 cups of milk it was just a banana puddle!"
"0","5","Excellent!!"
"0","5","Great dessert! I do agree that it was very sweet, but we loved it anyways. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it! I added some raspberries on the side, and it was a great addition! Thanks!"
"0","5","Incredibly easy and tasty. My only complaint would be it is VERY sweet. Not sure how you would lessen it but you can't eat as much as you might like to. My kids liked it a lot."
"0","5","Oh, my goodness, just what I was craving! And the MOMS group I took it to ate it all. Thanks I will make this again."
"0","5","The cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk is what takes this banana pudding from ordinary to extraordinary!"
"0","4","I made this for a co-worker's birthday. It tasted good but was more soupy than I expected. I was thinking it would be more firm."
"0","5","The best banana pudding I've had made with an instant pudding mix."
"0","5","A real crowd pleaser! Tasty and Easy!"
"0","5","Can I give the recipe six stars? So easy and so yummy. Made it for Easter and everyone loved it! I used a clear casserole dish and did two layers and it looked pretty too. Also used French Vanilla Cool Whip instead of plain. This is our new favorite dessert (and I can make it in just 10 minutes!!!!!)"
"0","5","This was a great recipe! It tasted great. Only problem was the cream cheese was lumpy. Other than that 5 stars."
"0","5","Made it for Easter and it was good. Made it a day before because I like my cookies soft."
"0","5","WONDERFUL!!I only used a half of the can of sweet milk and one package of vanilla and one package of banana cream pudding and whole milk(ice cold)and it was great. the best i have ever made. everyone was scraping their bowls!"
"0","5","This is the BEST Banana Pudding ever!!!"
"0","5","Perfection! BUT...I used Chessman cookies instead of wafers. People RAVED over it!"
"0","5","First time I have made banana pudding, ever. Recipe was perfect, I followed it exactly and not only was delicious, my father said it was just like his mother made and she has been passed for 25 years. It was wonderful, a favorite has been found."
"0","5","I made this for my boyfriend and it almost brought him to tears. As it turns out his grandmother used to make Banana Pudding, but since she passed he hadn't tasted one that seemed quite the same...until now. Thanks :)"
"0","4","This was my first banana pudding--I'd never eaten or made it before. I thought it was pretty good, but my guests weren't very interested. I really had to sell it to get anyone to eat it."
"0","5","really really good"
"0","5","I LOVED THIS RECIPE!! I followed the directions exactly, and it came out perfect! I did however use a deep glass bowl, and had about 3 thick layers. It tastes exactly like the banana pudding I had when i was a little girl- which is what I was looking for!! Thank you so much for this recipe- I will be taking this to many church functions! My husband also enjoyed it, and he isn't a sweets kind of person!!"
"0","5","Mmmm great recipe, I used reduced fat vanilla wafers and reduced fat cream cheese. My hubby said to use more wafers next time, I agree but I used more than half a box. This is a really sweet desert, but will keep this in my recipe book for the future.  Thanks for the submittal"
"0","5","Outstanding!"
"0","5","I have never had banana pudding, let alone made it. So I'm not sure how this compares...but it was REALLY good and I got a lot of compliments. The only change I made was to use 3/4 of the condensed milk and mini wafers instead of the bigger ones. I'll definitely be making this again. It was a nice change from all the chocolate desserts I normally make."
"0","5","Made a banana cream pie with this recipe by omitting the nilla wafers and adding it to a graham cracker crust. Also made with the nilla wafers. The only substitution I made was real whipped cream instead of the cool whip. We like whipped cream better. Can't wait to make this for my Dad who's favorite 'birthday cake' is Banana Cream Pie. Thanks!"
"0","5","I followed the recipe exactly and WOW was this ever good."
"0","5","I do not really care for banana pudding, but my kids do - so I made this yesterday for them, and I ended up trying a piece because it was such a different recipe than the one I usually use on the back of the Nilla Wafer box. It was so rich & creamy - very decadent!"
"0","5","This is my family's favorite banana pudding!! Very yummy!"
"0","5","Excellent and easy.. A++++ Momma would be proud."
"0","5","This is by far the best banana pudding recipe. My whole family loves it!!!  I followed the recipe- changed nothing. I sprinkled some crushed Nilla Wafers on top and mine has never lasted long enough for the bananas to turn brown :)"
"0","4","Very good banana pudding. My custard had little cream cheese lumps in it that I couldn't seem to get rid of, so I'll have to work on that next time, but everyone commented on how good it was! Also, I took other reviewers advice and did not use banana flavored pudding. This is great using the vanilla! thanks for the recipe!"
"0","4","This is a rich delicious treat! I took it up a notch by combining it with another banana pudding recipe on this site called 'extra special banana pudding' The coconut crust(I substituted brown sugar for white) on the bottom made this pudding the 'ultimate' banana pudding!My family loves it."
"0","5","I whipped this up over my lunch hour, and we had it for dinner tonight. I made it into individual servings in martini glasses. I used real whipped cream instead of cool whip because I prefer the real thing. Plus, it's less sweet. We really enjoyed it, and it was so quick and easy to make!"
"0","5","I have made this several times now, and it has always been fantastic! I have used strawberries instead of bananas, and today I am trying it without any fruit or cookies -- just by itself as a rich pudding. We'll see.."
"0","5","Absolutely delicous!! I made this recipie for Christmas & New Years, everyone loved it. I followed recipie, exactly. I sometimes layer this dish if I am putting it in a desert dish/bowl instead of a pan. I use cool whip on the top per the recipie but I also top it off this recpie with more wafers and bananas, which makes it very nice and has a good presentation!! Yum!!"
"0","4","My boys loved it. It was good in smaller portions, otherwise pretty rich."
"0","5","This was the best banana pudding I have ever had. My family devoured the whole thing in one day. I will definitely make it again, and soon!"
"0","4","I followed the recipe as shown; except I used the French Vanilla Cool Whip. Tasted great and made a great presentation for a church dinner. My kids prefer it when I put the pudding in a 3 quart bowl instead of a 9 x 13 pan. The secret to a great pudding is to follow the directions exactly as they are written."
"0","5","LOVED this recipe. I served it at my in-laws' Christmas dinner and it felt really good to hear my sister-in-law say 'Who made this? It's the best dessert on the whole table.' I made a huge 9X13 pan full and there was none left by the end of the day. Thank you sooo much!"
"0","5","Whenever we have a covered dish at work, everyone asks me to bring this. It's a hit no matter where I take it!"
"0","5","This is it, the recipe you were dying to get your hands on! I cannot tell you how many people beg me for this recipe. Truly one of the best desserts I have ever had. I follow the directions exact except I add slivered almonds on top for a nice texture surprise!"
"0","4","Mmmmm...Yummy!"
"0","5","This was delicious! I will be making this again. I followed the recipe exactly and we all loved it!!!!"
"0","5","Perfection! The wafers stay crispy and did not get soggy (as was my experience with cooked pudding instead of the instant), which is great for my family's taste."
"0","5","I have received so many wonderful compliments on the creaminess of the banana pudding. Everyone raves over it. Wonderful and great recipe."
"0","5","little too sweet- cut scm in half"
"0","4","This is a very rich dessert! I used one small box of vanilla and one small box of banana instant pudding and will definitely use just one large box of vanilla instant pudding next time.......too much banana taste. My husband loved it......and my son wrinkled up his nose (he doesn't like banana anything). I plan on making this again.....definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!"
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding I have ever made and it was easy. My husband loved it too. I will be making this often. I wonder if I can freeze this dish. For two people a 13 x 9 pan is two much at one time. It is so delicious we might try to eat the whole thing."
"0","5","Best banana pudding EVER - hands down! I've made this for about 5 different events now and never cease to hear how amazing it is. Thank you, thank you, thank you for a GREAT recipe!"
"0","5","Delicious! One of my family's favorites. I added 4 more ounces of whipped topping and 1-2 more bananas."
"0","5","Fantastic!!!!! My sister-in-law made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit! I couldn't wait for her to send the recipe."
"0","5","I usually make this in a glass Trifle bowl and double it to make numerous layers..It turns out beautiful an it is absolutely delicious..I've made it for family, friends, and work..They love it! The Best Pudding Ever.."
"0","5","Absolutely delicious!!! Easy to make and a new favorite for my family. Thanks for sharing."
"0","5","My new family favorite!"
"0","5","The best banana pudding I ever tasted. My family ate the whole thing in two days. Took the advice of another review and soaked the bananas in lemon juice. Gave the bananas a tangy sweeter flavor. Also added the vanilla flavor. Was a great it"
"0","5","VERY good! I read one comment that said they soaked the bananas in lemon juice to prevent the browning. While that did help the browning, it gave the pudding a tangy flavor that I didn't care for, but others loved, so just keep that in mind. Yum!"
"0","4","Wonderful... but really, really rich!"
"0","5","I just made this and it was AMAZING!! I followed the recipe exactly. It was super-easy & quick to make and the taste was so good! My father-in-law went back for more!"
"0","5","This is always a huge hit when I make it. An easy, delicious recipe thatis perfect for barbeques, baby/bridal showers and picnics."
"0","5","This is a recipe we have used in our family for years at large family gatherings and it is always the first dessert to be completly finished!"
"0","4","This recipe is wonderful! I followed it exactly as it say and it turned out perfect. My husband who is very picky about food LOVED IT!!! I wouldn't change a thing if you want it to turn out just right!"
"0","5","The best I've had and everyone loves it. However I always use banana cream pudding and didn't realize that recipe even called for vanilla until now. Maybe I'll try with vanilla one day but for potlucks and whenever I make it - there are never any leftovers. YUM."
"0","5","This recipe is a 10 on a scale from 1-5! I will never make the old fashioned kind again! I have fixed this 2 times in 3 weeks! Absolutely the VERY BEST!!"
"0","5","I took this to a country dinner with our church family and it was a huge hit! The dish was empty before I knew it! I did follow someone's idea to let the cream cheese come to room temp before I mixed it. That really made it easy to cream. It took me no time at all to make and it set quickly. Thanks!!"
"0","5","Very easy and GREAT !!!"
"0","1","I tried to make this banana pudding according to the recipe. I don't know what went wrong. I put inside the fridge as said overnight and my banana pudding turn soggy as well as the wafers."
"0","5","This is the best Banana Pudding that I have ever tasted. Every time I make it people always ask me to make it again. I would not change any thing that the recipe cause for because it has so much flavor in it. Love it!!!"
"0","5","This recipe one 1st place at my husband's company picnic bake-off contest, even though there was no baking involved. This is the best banana pudding ever! I have been asked over and over again to bring it to just about every event we go to where there will be food."
"0","5","OMG! This was so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and used whole milk. Everyone at the party loved it and it didn't last very long."
"0","5","This turned out wonderful. We liked it a lot. I got creative and put a broken-up Butterfinger on the top. I then used the remaining wafers and made a giant heart and my daughter put kisses in the heart like eyes and a smile. Excellent treat. Thanks."
"0","5","Just like everyone else I loved it. I made 2 batches of 9x13 pans for a 4th of July party...They both disappeared! I only use two cups of milk though because three makes mine to runny."
"0","4","Good, I will make it again. Its super sweet, so be prepared!"
"0","3","This easy recipe makes a traditional pudding which is good, but too sweet for my family. I think the condensed milk may be the culprit, and I plan to try another recipe without it."
"0","5","This was my first attempt at making banana pudding and it was easy and tasty! I used all the ingredients listed but i altered the finished product: instead of layering the wafers and banana, i crushed the wafters and stirred them into the pudding along with the sliced bananas. It tasted great! I'll probably use a little less condensed milk next time as i found this just a tad too sweet. Overall, great recipe!"
"0","5","Simply the best banana pudding possable*** Easy too, for us who are cooking impared. I used organic Bananas as they were the most ripe at the store. If you haven't tried them do. They have much more flavor that the others."
"0","5","Made this banana pudding sunday.. took to a potluck.... everyone raved over it .. huubby can't get enough..says deserves 100 stars.... Only change i'll make will be to use 2 cups milk. Thanks a million for the posting ."
"0","5","Having never made banana pudding before, I looked at a bunch of recipes and finally decided that since everything is better with cream cheese, to try this out. So incredibly easy and gone in a heartbeat. I got asked for the recipe over and over. The only thing I did differently was skip the final cool whip layer, because if I saved half the container I could make it again without a trip to the store! Simply one of the best recipes I've ever made from this website, and that's saying a lot!"
"0","5","This is amazing! I take this to Potluck BBQ's and everyone asks for the recipe. Definatley not a diet food, but well worth the guilt!!"
"0","5","I've always made from scratch cooked filling but decided for time sake to try this. I'm so glad I did. Everyone enjoyed this at the office pot luck - it was gone in no time flat!"
"0","5","Awesome! The Best Ever! Love this! Thanks so much for a great recipe."
"0","5","So good!! Tastes like the banana pudding I had as a child. To help keep the mix from splattering when mixing, I have learned to gradually add in the milk."
"0","5","This was a great recipe and really simple to make. My family is always requesting it now. Thanks!"
"0","5","My husband and I loved this banana pudding! It tasted heavenly, and it was so easy to make. This recipe is definitely one of our favorites."
"0","5","This a so yummy. Easy and delicious"
"0","5","This banana pudding was great! It did have a creamier taste than ordinary pudding. We all enjoyed it thanks!"
"0","5","The other reviews were helpful though I did get the problem with the cream cheese clumping even though I had it at room temperature (I missed the review which said to beat it with the sweetened condensed milk first which I'll try next time). I just kept beating the mixture and the clumps disappeared and the end result got rave reviews."
"0","3","Not bad, but not as good as mom used to make. Way too much cool whip in this recipe."
"0","5","Fantastic! I think I must have used real vanilla instead of extract, because I thought the vanilla taste was a bit too strong. I think it was my fault because my daughter has made this recipe and taken places several times and people always want her to make it again. So if you don't use vanilla extract use only 1/2 as much."
"0","5","This was sooooooo much better than instant!!! Definetly worth it. It was all gone within minutes!"
"0","5","this is the best banana pudding ever. And i'm picky lol. No suggested changes."
"0","5","Yum. I used 2 small packages of cheesecake pudding mix because that's all I had.....it was sweet, but very good! I tossed a little lemon juice with the bananas as others suggested, and this worked well. I agree with others who said it is better after a few hours, so that the wafers can soften a bit. My husband, myself and his brother ate half the pan! So addicting!"
"0","5","Such good banana pudding! It is definately a family favorite! I also added a little cinnamon for a tasty twist on the old familiar version."
"0","5","Excellent recipe. Will make again..tasted wonderful!"
"0","5","Everyone love it . It is now my thing to make for partys. Thand you."
"0","5","This is truly the most deliciously sinful dessert there is. Yum-mo!"
"0","5","Super easy and delicious! :)"
"0","5","Took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. Was very quick and easy to prepare. Because the filling is thick i'd be careful and not overdo on the cookie crust as it could become pasty. Would make again."
"0","5","I had never made any banana pudding before and this was terrific! Will always make this one from now on. I only had a 3.4 oz. packet of instant vanilla pudding, but I also had a 3.4 oz. packet of cheesecake instant pudding and used all of the vanilla and half of the cheesecake and it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!"
"0","5","My sister says this is the BEST banana pudding she has ever eaten and I agree."
"0","5","This was super easy and turned out great. I had so many compliments. Will definitely make again."
"0","5","Wow..this was great! I don't usually like 'instant' variations of desserts..but this one is actually better than the cooked version. It holds up way better and doesn't separate."
"0","5","Wow! This was wonderful! Used French Vanilla Pudding. This is a keeper for sure!"
"0","5","This was the BEST Banana Pudding I have ever made...even my picky husband LOVED it. Thank you for this wonderful recipe."
"0","5","This was really good, my daughter loved it. Will make again , thanks"
"0","5","Wow - what a winner. My 10yo made this for dessert - she was so proud of the result. Really tasty."
"0","5","I make this for pitch-ins at work. There is never anything left to take home."
"0","5","very yummy! it's even better the second day, after the nilla wafers get a little moist. I'd imagine this would be a huge hit at a potluck, and it makes a lot. As you can guess, this one is a hit with the kids."
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!!"
"0","5","This banana pudding is awesome! Thank you so much for this recipe, it's very easy. Be sure and make a double batch... you will need it!"
"0","5","Awesome. Very hard to eat just one piece"
"0","5","I love this recipe. It definitely hits the spot."
"0","4","I decided to try this because the normal recipe is just a little too tedious. I used a glass pyrex bowl so that everyone could see the pudding and cookies. It made a very nice presentation.Instead of using vanilla pudding we used banana. The pudding had a good taste although the cream cheese seemed to make it a bit too thick.It was a cinch to make and the longer it sat in the fridge it seemed to taste better."
"0","5","awsome"
"0","5","You WILL be the talk of your occasion if you bring this dish!!!"
"0","5","This is very easy, very pretty and very good. Really enjoyed this dessert. I put it in a bowl and covered the top in Banana slices. Will definitely make again!"
"0","5","this ROCKS!!!!!!!"
"0","5","A very good recipe. Not too sweet like other banana puddings that I have eaten. I will definitely be making this one again!"
"0","5","Super Yummy. I'm taking it to a school staff luncheon tomorrow, and of course, had to sample it first. Thanks for sharing!"
"0","5","This recipe was wonderful and I don't even like Bananas. I made it for a sick neighbor and keep a small bowl of it for us. My husband agreed that it is really good. I will make it again real soon."
"0","5","DELICIOUS!!!!My husband loved it and so did I."
"0","5","My family absolutely LOVES this recipe! I make it for special occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas or birthdays when the entire extended family is together. I have to make two trays because it disappears so fast."
"0","5","I do not care for banana pudding - but I made this for the group that I work with and it got great reviews. Everyone came back for seconds - it is WONDERFUL......."
"0","5","Best banana pudding ever! Thanks so much."
"0","5","WOW! I'm a huge 'nanner puddin' fan, so I'd have to say this is one of the best yet! Very good and my whole family loved it, I suggest you double it if you want seconds! Thanks!"
"0","5","Fabulous"
"0","4","Really good! My dad requested a graham cracker crust next time, so I'll have to give that a try."
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding my or my guests have ever had! We even nicknamed it Banana Heavan. Its got wonderful flavors as well and the smoothest texture you will ever taste! I thank the person who posted this recipe! It was a real hit at my party and is now a staple in my entertaining menu!"
"0","5","Man, this banana pudding is THE BOMB!!! My family LOVES this pudding! My hubby requested this pudding for Father's Day dinner and I made a DOUBLE batch that was absolutely HUGE and every bit was gone by the next day. Great texture and taste, highly recomended!"
"0","5","Made this for a lunch and it was fantastic used a graham cracker crust instead of waffers and it was great. this would be good with any fruit."
"0","5","Very, very good. Took to a potluck at work and it was gone by lunch time."
"0","3","Good, but nothing to rave about."
"0","2","Way too sweet for our family... and I have a huge sweet tooth."
"0","5","What a hit anywhere I take it! Everyone loves this pudding...the only change I made is to use fat free or lite on all the ingredients possible. You can't tell the difference, I have made it both ways."
"0","4","Not bad. But, I'm an old fashioned Southern Girl, so I like the regular kind!"
"0","4","We liked it my only complaint is the wafers went soggy, I will try a cruched wafer crust or even graham next time. THis is almost exactly my no bake cheese cake recipe just with the pudding and milk added and only half the whip cream, I think I will try to add the whole 8 oz whip cream and still put some more on top in hopes it won't be as dry as a cheesecake. Very good will make again but tweak it a bit!"
"0","5","Very good. Someone else suggested making sure the cream cheese is blended well -- I will make sure to do that next time!"
"0","5","At every family event, this is the dessert everyone wants!! Incredibly easy!"
"0","5","Another convert to Patricia's recipe...soon, the entire world will be simply covered in her creamy banana-y goodness."
"0","5","I don't even like Banana Pudding and this gets 5 stars from me! My mother-in-law told me this was the best she's ever had!!!"
"0","4","I just made this and WOW I am not making banana pudding any other way from now on! My dh really likes b.pudding but I hate to make it. This is so easy, and creamy, and just good! I read the other reviews and I also used 1 3oz. box instant banana pudding and 1 3oz. box french vanilla. I also just mixed all the whipped topping into the pudding directly. This makes a LOT too. The leftovers will be really good eaten like a frozen dessert. My leftover filling I froze and made pudding pops out of. Yummy!!! Note: If you like heavy custard type banana pudding with meringue, this is not for you. This is a fluffy, lighter filling."
"0","5","I must admit. This recipe is by far the best I have ever tasted. My family loves for me to bring it to every single family gathering, as well as my co-workers. Thank you for revealing this hidden treasure. I won't ever need another Banana Pudding recipe again!"
"0","5","JUST TRIED AND HUBBY LOVED IT! HE SAID I WILL HAVE TO MAKE THIS MORE OFTEN!...DEFINITELY GOING IN MY RECIPE BOX...THANKS"
"0","5","This was an absolute hit with my family and a big surprise birthday party where I made a huge pan. Everyone at the party wanted to know who made the banana pudding! The only changes I made were to use banana cream and cheese cake instant pudding and I forgot to include the vanilla extract but later realized that it's really not needed. I'll use this recipe from now on! Thx!"
"0","5","This is the best recipe ever! It has been a hit at my house and others as well. The only changes I make is to use 1 cup of soy milk and 2 cups of regular milk. This gives it a little extra taste of vanilla to it. If you like warm banana pudding you can always put this in the microwave and it tastes like it came out of the oven. I will never make banana pudding any other way!"
"0","5","Everyone loved this! I added about 1/2 of another box of the pudding to thicken it, and left the whipped topping for 'topping' and it got rave reviews. The flavor of the pudding mixture was so good. This is an excellent recipe."
"0","5","So delicious!!!! I couldn't stop eating it! It gets even better with time."
"0","5","This is by far the best banana pudding iv'e made."
"0","5","so great!!"
"0","5","This is a great recipe for an easy no-bake banana pudding. I've made it several times and everybody loves it! Turns out especially nice and creamy after staying in the fridge overnight because all the ingredients are joined together."
"0","5","Deilicious!! The only change I made was to use 2 c. of heavy whipping cream in place of the cool whip, this kept it from being so sweet. It made a great recipe perfect."
"0","5","This is the Best Banana Pudding ever! I have to make it all the time for family events. My mother is addicted to it! I use no whip cream on top and only a few bananas...it's great!"
"0","5","Very simple recipe that appeals to all ages. No need to change a thing. It comes out perfect every time."
"0","4","WOW!! This is yummy!! I only used 1/2 a can of condensed milk, you could probably get away with not using it at all. I also used low fat cream cheese."
"0","4","Boy is this rich! We really liked it, but I think next time I will use perhaps a 'banana' pudding, would like more banana flavor. Easy to put together, and I used the whole box of wafers. Was anybody else's mixture really thin? I thought perhaps I had done something wrong. But after it set, it was ok, but could have been firmer."
"0","3","I made this for my hubby who loves his moms. He said it was ok...I thought I could taste the cream cheese and the condensed milk to much and no banana flavor. It still tasted good though. I did have to use my own whipped cream (from whipping cream) so maybe thats why. Next time I will use frozen."
"0","5","YUM! This recipe is super rich and delicious! I used the whole box of wafer cookies and layered it in a pretty glass bowl. My family of 5 gobbled it up within 2 days! My mom used to make a banana pudding with just vanilla pudding, wafers and cool whip, and I used to love it. This just puts her recipe to shame....shhhh! Don't tell her I said that."
"0","5","Mouth watering!!!! I made this for a dinner at my church and they loved it. I am not a banana pudding fan but this gave me a new love for banana pudding."
"0","5","Great recipe! Extremely rich. Not for the faint of heart. I made it once and am now stuck making it for every gathering. Very easy. A definite keeper."
"0","4","Pretty darn good, but not quite a five star. Easy to make, always a plus!"
"0","5","I have been looking high and low for a good banana pudding recipe. One that's not too rich but has enough filling to it. I decided to use this recipe because it had such good reviews from other members. They were all right....this recipe is so simple and yet it's absolutely perfect. I decided to try out the recipe for a party I was going to and it was a huge hit. Apparently I didn't make enough of it because it was gone within 30 minutes of putting it out on the table. As well as placing the banana slices on the bottom of the dish I also folded them into the pudding itself to give it that delicious banana flavor."
"0","5","Absolutely wonderful!!! Didn’t change a thing."
"0","5","This is definitely a five star recipe with my modifications, but a bit too sweet for me when I make this exact version. I completely eliminate the condensed milk in the pudding- you really don't need it and it is way too sweet! First, I use all of the cool whip in the pudding. I layer the bottom of the pan with slices of pound cake, add a layer of about 7 sliced bananas (4 is not enough), then the layer of pudding mixture and finally top with a layer of your favorite crushed shortbread cookie (not quite a full package of cookies). This is to die for!!! I bring it all the time as a potluck dessert and it goes very quick- people always want the recipe. A little more whip cream on top never hurts too!"
"0","5","I made this for a party and Everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was use two small pans so I could have it layered. It was so good I will never cook my banana pudding again. Thank you so much."
"0","5","This is by far the best bananna pudding I have ever eaten. I have used another good recipe that called for sour cream but this definetly wins for taste! I followed the ingredients exactly except I used a whole box of wafers and two extra bananas and layered mine. I just can not have a one layer banana pudding! Still deserves 5 stars or even more than 5!!!!"
"0","5","I got rave reviews and recipe requests for this one. It was a little sweet for me, but not for most. I substituted cheesecake pudding mix for the vanilla."
"0","5","I agree with the other ratings, this is so easy and it's awesome."
"0","5","If there was a 10 star rating, this recipe would most definitely have it. I have tried so many other recipes for banana pudding but this one beats them all. There is no comparison! Thank you so much for sharing this delicious treat, my whole family is going to enjoy it for many years to come. A family favorite for sure!!!"
"0","4","This recipe is very good. My fiance doesn't like bananas and he loved it. (He even asked for seconds!) I did read other reviews before making. I followed the recipe exactly, then I also crumbled up the rest of the wafers and put on top. I will make this again, but I will not crumble the wafers and put on top. I didn't really like it too much. I also used extra creamy whip cream. I thought I wouldn't have enough for the top, but it just enough. Thanks for the recipe Patricia!"
"0","5","Very rich. Excellent!"
"0","5","This is such an awesome recipe!!!! The family loved it and raved about it. A Keeper!!"
"0","5","Well, add another rave review to this recipe. This is soooo good. I followed recipe exactly and used some of the tips from a previous reviewer- making sure cream cheese was room temp, milk was ice cold, and ingrediants well beaten. Sprinkled the top with crushed up nilla wafers. Best banana pudding I have ever had. This will be my recipe from now on. Thank you so much, Patricia, for sharing this recipe!"
"0","5","I made this for some friends this weekend and it turned out awesome. Everyone loved it. I will keep this recipe in my favorites."
"0","5","This is an excellent banana pudding and very, very easy to make. It tastes just like a banana cream pie. I layered mine in a trifle dish and it was the hit of the party. It's even better the next day when the vanilla wafers have softened. Next time I will try pound cake instead of the vanilla wafers. Highly recommend this one!"
"0","5","Huge Hit. The entire pudding was devoured. And there was a lot of it. Everyone was begging for the recipe. Very pleased with the results. Thanks!"
"0","5","this is the best banana pudding i've ever had. my family loved it and keep asking when i'm gonna make it again.."
"0","5","Excellent dessert for summer. Kids loved this recipe! I have to say we all did. I made it as directed first time and it turned out excellent. The second time, I thought I would add the condensed milk into the bowl with the cream cheese to help keep the cream cheese from sticking to the beaters; however, when I added the pudding, milk, and vanilla, I had little glops of cream cheese and condensed milk that didn't want to separate. I was taking the dish to work and really wanted it to be the best. When we dipped in, I didn't see the little glops and it tasted excellent. I suppose it had time to dissolve while chilling. I was so relieved."
"0","5","I have a reputation of being the worst cook in the universe, and after I made this recipe for my parents I was told that this was the best banana pudding they had ever tasted!"
"0","5","This banana pudding recipe was a hit at our family reunion. Wonderful. Will definitely make again. So creamy. YUM!"
"0","5","Yummy! My family loved this! I used Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies instead of the vanilla wafers. I will be making this again and again."
"0","5","Wow..Decadent and delicious. My girlfriend made this for me and we had enough to feed the neighborhood! Excellent, but the recipe makes a HUGE amount. Thank you!"
"0","5","Made this yesterday.I am always curious to try the 5 star recipes. I can see why it is getting all the high ratings. Awesome! Followed  recipe just as it was written. I wouldn't change anything. I will be making this for our July 4th party- i agree it is ADDICTIVE!!"
"0","5","EXCELLENT! I used low-fat versions of the milk, cream cheese, and condensed milk and fat-free whipped topping and this was still a huge hit. Many people wanted the recipe at our weekly family gathering and requested I make it again the following week."
"0","4","Very good. I really liked the cream cheese addition. No changes made here."
"0","4","This recipe was really good. It was better after letting it sit overnight. I thought I would be able to taste the cream cheese in the pudding, but I didn't. It was quite rich and creamy vanilla flavor. I would recommend this for a quick and easy dessert, but I really think the Old fashioned version of Banana pudding is better. But for a quick recipe this one was incredible. Doesn't taste like instant pudding whatsoever. Everyone will love it."
"0","5","I made this for my husband and his coworkers, and it was totally devoured. Absolutely wonderful. Best banana pudding I've ever had."
"0","5","this banana pudding is very good, everyone said it was the best they ever had, thanks"
"0","5","very good and easy. family loved it! I didn't have vanilla wafers and cinnamon grahams worked well with a dusting of cinnamon on top."
"0","5","The banana pudding turned out wonderful. I would definately make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","This was VERY well-liked at the two occasions I served it! I made the recipe pretty much as it is written. I did dip the bananas in a bowl with a waterlemon juice mixture first so they wouldn't turn brown. I used Neufatchel (sp?) instead of regular cream cheese and I used the Extra creamy Cool Whip. I served it in a large glass punch bowl, so I doubled the layers. Crushed a few of the wafers and sprinkled on top. It was Heavenly!"
"0","5","This is by far teh most wonderful banana pudding my family has ever tasted. THIS IS GREAT!! A must for every family. No changes to the recipe needed."
"0","5","I tried this recipe for a family gathering so I doubled the ingredients It turned out to be a very large pan. But my family finished it off and wanted more. It was a great success."
"0","5","I had my doubts, thinking maybe it would taste like simple packaged pudding with bananas mixed in. But I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was great. I sliced the bananas lenthwise to get long, thin strips, which just meant I had less pieces to lay down to cover the pan. The only change I'll make next time is to use a larger tub of Cool-Whip, putting the same amount in the mixture, but leaving more to use for the finish. Oh, I used 1/3 less-fat cream cheese, 2% milk, and fat-free condensed milk, it came out thick and creamy and you'd never know it had a little less fat. Fat free Cool-Whip would help out even more, I bet. Thanks, Patricia, I was pleasantly suprised!"
"0","5","Incredible (!!) and easy to make. I honestly think I like this better than my original recipe using homemade vanilla pudding."
"0","5","Scrumptious! The addition of cream cheese makes this just wonderful! Thank you for submitting this!"
"0","5","Excellent! Great recipe! Looks pretty in a triffle dish too."
"0","5","Very good! This is the first time I've made banana pudding, or tasted it, and this recipe was wonderful. I followed it exactly, and used an oval, clear glass dish that made the presentation of it look great. It's a great party dish because it makes alot. We had enough leftover from our dinner party of 6 to pack some up for friends to take home. We finished our leftovers tonight. YUM! Thanks for a great recipe!"
"0","5","Fantastic recipe!! I wow my friends with it everywhere I bring it."
"0","5","I've made this twice now and it's so delicious, easy & light. Instead of using vanilla wafers (hubby doesn't like them) I am using a graham or shortbread pie crust and it's GREAT!!! Makes 2 pies."
"0","5","took a bit to get the creamcheese to smooth out...but once it did - FANTASTIC."
"0","5","This was the best banana pudding I have ever tasted, It made quite alot so next time I will make half of the recipe."
"0","5","Wow, We can't get enough of this!!!! It is awesome & very addicting. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!!"
"0","5","This is by far the best banana pudding I have ever tasted. It is very creamy and rich. The ingredients really compliment each other."

"0","5","Never had banana pudding made this way. My whole family plus a guest was very impressed with it."
"0","4","Used French Vanilla Cool Whip and French Vanilla Pudding.   Also substituted sour cream for the cream cheese and used the Pepperidge Farm Chessman in Butterscotch!  A definite crowd pleaser!!"
"0","5","This recipe was easy and everyone loved it."
"0","4","If i gave 5 stars this would get it, only thing i changed was that i used banana pudding instead of vanilla and 2 small box's instead of 1 large. Great recipe thanx"
"0","5","So good that my family won't even give it time for the wafers to go soft before it's all eaten up!I also use a large glass bowl and layer it,as it just looks more delicious that way. This was my first banana pudding and i will forever use this recipe."
"0","4","Very nice consistency (can be sliced) but it didn't taste a lot like bananas. Next time I will use riper bananas."
"0","4","For not homemade this was really good, I brought it to work for a bbq and some guys loved it, some said home-made was still better."
"0","5","Really delicious! I just got done making it for the second time. The first time was on Mother's Day and it was a definite hit. Kids love it, and so do adults. Really great! I'm keepin' this recipe!!!!"
"0","3","Very unique recipe...tastes good the first day, but even better the next. You might want to try a banana-flavored pudding if you want more of the banana-taste! Thank you!"
"0","5","This was quick, easy and delicious! Exactly what I was craving..... a heavenly dessert that I will definitely make again and again."
"0","5","Super Easy to make yet looks and taste like I spent a long time on it! I even let my two year old use an egg slicer on the bananas and it became a family project! Great recipe!!!!"

"0","5","The BEST recipe out there for banana pudding PERIOD!"
"0","3","This is a good recipe, but I wouldn't call if fabulous. Too sweet for my taste, and too much of a cheesecake-like flavor. Good, but not great."

"0","5","i have never tasted a better banana pudding!! it was so easy to make and my family loves it! thank you!!"
"0","5","My petulant husband says this isn't banana pudding unless you use just banana pudding for the pudding base - otherwise it's just pudding with bananas on top. I plan to make this for him using banana pudding to satisfy his discriminating palate."
"0","5","i never knew that my son {he is 7} and my husband could eat so much! we all loved this recipe. very good on a hot day."
"0","5","My favorite banana pudding recipe."
"0","5","This no bake Pudding was the best I ever tasted !!!For now on when I have to bring a dish to a Party or Cook-out, this will be it. I changed one thing, I used banana creme pudding mix instead of vanilla like the recipe said. And it was still the BOMB."

"0","5","I made this for a party we had for my nephew when he left for college. Everyone there absolutely loved it. It was gone in no time. Now I am asked to bring it to almost every gathering except now I take two pans instead of one! Thanks for a great hit!"
"0","5","This dessert is yummy! The cream cheese makes it very rich and delicious."
"0","5","Excellent! I used one box banana cream pudding mix and one box vanilla. Instead of whipped topping on top, I crushed up some nilla wafers and put them on top. I used one box of nilla wafers, had two layers of wafers, bananas and pudding. Delicious!!! Thanks a lot!"
"0","5","I used 2 small boxes of pudding mix instead of one large one and put a top layer of wafers and bananas. Absolutely sinful!! Rich and delicious...best banana pudding I've ever had."
"0","5","This is a very rich version of an old family favorite! This should be savored slowly but who can wait for something so wonderful!!!!"
"0","5","Awesome!! Very yummy, it disappears as soon as it is made."
"0","4","Big Hit!"
"0","3","I took the suggestions and used the 2 small boxes of bananna pudding mix instead of the vanilla an added the remaining cookies on the top.  The pudding was Ok - not great! I wish that I had not added the whipped cream on the top and the extra cookes - that was way too much.  Also, my banannas turned an ugly color the next day so I wouldn't make it too far in advance of serving.  I would not make this recipe again!"
"0","4","This turns out very rich and delicious! And it's really easy, too!"
"0","5","This is the best banana pudding I have ever tasted. Everyone loves it and wants to know the recipe. This is the fifth weekend in a row that I will be preparing it. I had to make two for the Thanksgiving holiday!!! Thanks Patricia."

"0","5","The best banana pudding I have had in a long time. It's really tasty. I am pleased to have found this recipe! Angela"
"0","5","This is by far the BEST banana pudding I have ever had. Three people wanted the recipe after I made it. Like others, I like to use a large bowl and layer with two layers of wafers and bananas. I also think it is best to wait overnight to serve. It gives the bananas a chance to infuse into the pudding. If you haven't tried this recipe yet, you are missing out!!!"
"0","5","Absolutely fabulous! Comfort food at its best."
"0","5","My family loves this recipe I made it 3 weekends in a row.They still ask for more."
"0","5","I made this for a family birthday party. Everyone kept telling me it was the BEST banana pudding they ever had. I used banana cream pudding instead of vanilla. It turned out heavenly!!!"
"0","5","This was excellent! I could'nt find the large size pudding mix so I used 2 of the smaller size onees. I used 1 each of vanilla and banana. I also layered everything in a bowl."
"0","5","Very easy! Guests liked it. I made it the previous day for a party. I would recommend adding three-fourths the can of condensed milk. I omitted the cool whip on top. Tasted not too rich, nor too sweet."
"0","5","This pudding was so good, my husband said 'It's the best banana pudding I've ever eaten!!' when I made it for his birthday. We'll definitely make it again!!"
"0","5","Our family and guests loved it."
"0","5","Rich yet superb! I used instant banana cream pudding instead, an entire box of wafers and crushed some on top. (Colored wafers make it pretty). Will probably layer next time in a smaller, deeper dish. An instant hit with the family and definately a keeper!"
"0","5","This is so good! I did, however, change one thing. Instead of layering the cookies, bananas, and pudding in a 9x13, I made two layers in a glass bowl and then topped it with the cool whip and some extra cookies. Scrumptious!"
"0","5","This is a great and easy recipe. I added some crushed pineapples. This gave it a very unique taste also."
"0","5","this was the best ever!!! i never even like banana pudding before this...also i heard that to keep the bananas from darkening, dip them in lemon juice - i will try that next time."
"0","5","This is FANTASTIC! It has become an immediate family hit, with both my husband and daughter requesting that I make it again and again."
"0","5","I made this for Easter and it was SO delicious. Very quick and easy. The cream cheese adds such a yummy flavor!! Definitely a keeper recipe."
"0","5","This banana pudding recipe was fast, easy and delicious! The cream cheese gives it a unique flavor, different from the ordinary!"
"0","5","I made this for Sunday Dinner yesterday and it was great! The only thing that I might change is - instead of Vanilla Pudding - I may use Banana Crream next time to give it more banana flavor. Thanks for sharing, we really enjoyed it!"
